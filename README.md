# small-reviews
A tiny project for me to keep track of things I've had thoughts about after finishing them

This was originally a little React site for playing around with, but I then ported it to Eleventy in July 2023. 
Here's some info on how to run it: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/

Use --serve to start up a hot-reloading local web server.

```npx @11ty/eleventy --serve```
By default runs on http://localhost:8080/
