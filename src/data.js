        thoughts: "Another book my husband never finished and I eventually nicked. He'd bought three in the series and there was enough in this to move on to them at some point, but it wasn't a classic for me. It felt a bit clunky to read at points, in the way that translated things often do, but I appreciated the translator's postscript saying that 'the reader sees a glimpse of another culture's pattern of thinking, hears an echo of another language's rhythms and cadences, and feels a tremor of another people's gestures and movements'. The strange in-game scenes reminded me of something else but I can't remember what, and I enjoyed flicking between that and the real world with everything explained by the end, but I did find some of the science a bit hard to wrap my tired brain around at points. Still, some interesting concepts and I'll read on."

        thoughts: "Another game that's finished-but-not-finished as there's a zillion achievements and I may mop some more up, but my enthusiasm is waning a bit now as there's just too many to get through. This was a fun little game which was very up my street in terms of puns, silly references, and 4th wall breaking. I laughed when Left Shark made an appearance, but it was even better to get to add that as my costume. Gameplay and story-wise it was very enjoyable if a bit repetitive, and the main things that let it down for me were mostly technical niggles: not having a way to calibrate the audio, the music being really monotonous and samey at times, wishing I could replay just individual fights rather than 1h+ entire levels, achievements not stacking, general collectables being locked behind some bloody hard SPECTRA doors, and needing at least 5 full play throughs just to be able to get everything is silly. But it's a silly game, and I forgive it purely on the basis of the 'kenkyuu very much' pun in the Japanese audio."

        thoughts: "This was the first book where I didn't know what was going to happen, and it was somewhat strange and exciting because of it. The time leap threw me off – everyone's suddenly got older and I felt a bit of a sense of disconnection, but I guess that's what all the novellas are for (I haven't read any yet as I don't really like e/audiobooks). Despite that, this was a meaty story with lots going on on different fronts, and it feels like it put a lot of time into setting up the last couple of books. It's definitely left everything on a bit of a cliffhanger. Lots of action, lots of political wranglings and lessons, and lots of 'oh just one more chapter then's."

But I loved this. I was recently asked why I only gave the previous game 3 stars, which made me look back. And they've basically fixed all of the things that annoyed me before. Ok, so the first time I had to fly a birdthing I found it incredibly unintuitive, some of the platforming was still janky, but there was so much to love that I could put that aside this time. The big, open worlds were a joy. The huge amount of collectables were right up my street, coupled with being marked on the map to mop up at just the right pacing. The map is actually useful! There is fast travel! Riding things! The story was great, and I actually spoiled it for myself because I now really like Merrin and I was getting worried she may not be ok. Some of the force tears were wickedly hard, but I managed them with some persistence. Really great game, can't wait for more."

        thoughts: "I liked this more as it went on and all the strands came together, and it was a decent time travel read that wrapped up all the mysteries nicely... but overall something still left me a little bit cold. I think it may have been that I just didn't care about the characters very much. I actually felt a bit like Gaspery at the point where he still felt able to be detached about knowing how and when the people would die. They never really properly came alive for me. However I also definitely find pandemic-related content a bit less fun to read nowadays, and I think this probably suffered a bit in the same way as how I felt about 'How high we go in the dark' in terms of the setting."

The sheer range of characters who took point on chapters made this almost feel like a collection of short stories, as some of them were real nobodies who never got another chance to narrate, just popping up in other characters' goes. That said, I did actually enjoy that we got to see a bit from the Free Navy on Medina's perspective of how it all went down. Seeing Filip develop was also interesting to read, and I enjoyed how him and Marco read slightly differently to the other characters."

It continued to have fewer of the core team narrating chapters, the on-planet bits really dragged, and for large chunks of the book both Elvi and Basia were pretty annoying. However, I did enjoy both Basia and Havelock being a continuation of previous appearances, unlike in the TV show. Still very enjoyable, but I'm hoping for a bit more excitement and a bit less moping and mud in the next book."

This one I felt like I enjoyed slightly less, but the thought of giving it anything less than a 4 felt daft, so 4 it is. I think it was because so much of this one focuses on non-core characters, although Melba/Clarissa was my favourite. On finishing I went and read all the TV summaries to compare, and a _lot_ differs in this, especially with the weird smushing of Pa/Ashford/Drummer/Sam/Bull. Lots of action, lots of pace, and heading straight into book 4 to keep it up."

Which I guess was kind of like the TV show when it reached this point. My memory is a bit hazy, but there are definitely some divergences from the adaptation in here, which did keep it more fresh for my brain than book 1. But also, the writing and characters are just so rich, and I loved spending more time with them. Avasarala and Bobbie were my faves in this book (obviously), but I'm also enjoying reclaiming being able to like Alex. Just great writing, and I couldn't resist ordering book 3 to jump into next."

This was perfect, it was very cute and surprisingly fun. You're chucked straight in, no guide to the controls, and no explanation. Initially I found some frustration with things like not realising the grid wasn't straight... but soon that changed into \"oh cool, it did _that_!\". What you build, and how that relates to the structures and grid around it means you get little delighters, like buildings changing into a lighthouse, or washing being hung out between two towers. I loved that birds settled on my wooden struts and roof of another large building. I played longer than I expected, and really enjoyed the gentle exploration it encouraged."

The early pages are sickly sweet cheese, focusing on two characters who \"babe\" each other and generally seemed extremely annoying. Thankfully (mild spoiler) one gets killed off shortly after (hooray!), and the clumsy writing only reared its head a couple more times (the description of period pains was classic). It felt like a bit of a slog to get through, as whilst there's several acts and stuff happens, none of it felt super captivating to me. The story is interesting enough though, and it's very well thought out in terms of all of the hard details, for me it just could have done with being a bit more punchy and a bit less clumsy when it comes to a man writing about a woman."

The sense of play and exploration it gave me when the world opened up properly and I could start to experiment with cause and effect was brilliant, and I'm still enjoying mopping up the last few bits I'd missed. The story was fun, the combat was fun, the powers were fun. I found it hard without being annoying, although at one point (ClassPass/Juliana issues) I was sorely tempted to up my number of Reprises but thankfully couldn't figure out why it was locked so didn't (I later realised it unlocks in between levels...). Now the game's over I feel horrendously overpowered, and I've been enjoying trying to get missing achievements in ways which make me use non-standard loadouts and play styles to get them done. More than once I fell asleep at night thinking about how to run part of a level, and I think this game will be genuinely memorable for me."

It's basically exactly the same, even down to reusing environments, but that doesn't detract from it still being fun to play. I enjoyed it, but it loses marks for having three achievements completely bug and refuse to pop, one of which took me ages to make sure I got it. There were also little UI fails, like the markers for the contracts being off by default, which made me completely forget about them on the first mission until I saw them pop up as fails. Little bits of frustration like that ultimately just took the shine off it."

You see some of the plot points coming a mile off, but that doesn't take away from letting it all play out.

I think I was initially put off by thinking it was scary (it's not) way back, but on seeing it on Game Pass I downloaded it at some point before I got distracted by Overwatch 2. I happened to see it was leaving very soon, and that was the kick I needed to crack on, so I motored through it in a few hours over the last few days. I felt like the wilderness was a bit tedious and empty and this plus some clunky movement didn't make me want to explore, which was a bit of a missed opportunity.

Binti was a character that I could get behind from the start, and the descriptions of prejudice and difference made me both feel for her, but also helped build the world really quickly. There were a number of new terms and fantastical concepts (a ship that was a giant space prawn!) but unlike the previous book I read, I found it easy to imagine the concepts. I only wish it was a bit longer and extensive, as it felt more like a short story than a novella but I'd definitely be keen to read more."

Even after finishing this book and getting the 'explainer chapters' at the end, there are fundamental bits I simply don't understand. Apparently I'm not alone, with a ton of people on Goodreads experiencing similar. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to use my imagination, and I don't need it spelled out to me exactly what a servitor, formation instint, or exotic weapons are exactly. But right from the start the sheer level of never explained terms made the world-building feel weak and disconnected for me. Characters with non-memorable names were thrown in and soon disappear, leading to a lot of 'am I meant to know this name?' too. Despite all that, I did like the central concept, and I'm open to reading more in the series as it sounds like they're a bit more accessible...and maybe will help me put some of the pieces together about this book!"

I'd seen it on various lists and reviews, and knew the name when it later sat around our house as one of the books my husband bought for a holiday but never read. After all that time, I was disappointed that it was not for me. It starts by describing 'Mrs Flynn the Barman's arse' which got us off on the wrong foot, but I was prepared to put this down to the narration rather than the author. And whilst there's a lot in a similar vein, it wasn't that that did it. \n\nIt took me at least 200 long pages of the overall 582 to remotely get into the story (which actually ends up being reasonably interesting as a concept, if a bit chaotic and all over the place in execution). This book suffers hugely from wild ramblings, in both tangents and style of writing. On one page there's a sentence with 193 words, which sadly isn't an exception. If it was a third of the size and written differently I'd have liked it a lot more. A shame!"

If anything it reminded me more of Halt and Catch Fire. This is a beautifully written book, which perfectly captures all kinds of very human emotions and situations. The plot itself for me felt secondary to the characters, who had wonderful depth and flaws, and who felt very real after spending more and more time reading. At one point there's a very notable event, and I found myself wanting to cheat and look ahead to see if everything turned out ok or not, because I was that invested. For others the video game heavy content will be too much, but for me it was a big draw. Loved it."

In this collection of essays around motherhood (in all kinds of forms) I unexpectedly found so much resonated, but it was instead reaffirming and gave voice to many things I'd experienced and felt but maybe hadn't had the words for. I wanted to underline things to come back to, but there'd have been so much. It's a book that I'd give someone else, in the hope that they too may take so much from it."

I didn't get this book at all, which makes me feel like I'm missing something and am stupid, but I found this disjointed, without substance, repetitive, and just bloody confusing. Even after finishing I have absolutely no idea what was going on with the disappearing, which felt utterly out of place in the story about the mother's decline. I read this over a day and a half, during times where I was settling the baby's milk. That's a fast read for me, and it was partly so because I skimmed over so much of the repetitive incoherent babbling sections, and overly elaborate but tedious descriptions.

It's a standalone book from a universe I haven't read anything else from, but that side was ok apart from the glossary at the start making it feel more daunting than it actually was. I was going to give it 3.5 as the plot was fun and engaging enough, but as I got through the last couple of chapters I decided to downgrade it. For me, there was just too much unnecessary nastiness (mostly gore, but about 4 different explosive shitting scenes), even for an action book. I also wasn't a fan of the entirely unneeded and lazily thrown in rape scene at the start to show a character is A Bad Dude. Plus The Big Reveal at the end was incredibly obvious from much earlier on. And don't get me started on the cliched sex scene. Looking on Goodreads just now the reviews are a series of gushing men, and that's how this book feels – a blokey bloke's read."

I found the slightly mysterious and mostly left to your imagination world-building an interesting setting for the story, and enjoyed both Klara's narration/perspective and the other characters she interacts with."

        thoughts: "Engaging plot, and I enjoyed the character development and team building. Combat was fun enough but often too chaotic to be properly tactical with getting individuals to lock on to specific targets, and some mechanics were pretty confusing even after finishing. I still have a load of combat-related achievements locked and can't work out whether it's because they're bugged or if I just don't know how to trigger the thing it wants 🤷🏻‍♀️. Anything to do with flying the ship was horrible."

However as I went on, I really enjoyed revisiting the characters and story. On finishing it I'm looking forward to working my way through the rest. And it's also worth acknowledging that it's just a bloody good read, with or without the TV show."

Given the framing I was hoping there'd be more writing about the city itself, but it was actually pretty limited. Jumps from monster story, to semi-explicit sex fantasies, to family dynamics. Lots of it felt obviously translated, and actually left me wishing it had included the Japanese too, so I could read the originals."

The pacing is absolutely bang on, I loved the evolving interactions between SecUnit and the ship, but also the introduction of storytelling from different, er, perspectives (no spoilers) brought an interesting but cohesive different dynamic to the story itself. Action, intrigue, amusing parts, humanity, was nothing I didn't like."

This one breaks with the series and is told from the view of Mensah. It adds an interesting second perspective on a couple of points, but there was something about the writing style and narrative that didn't feel like it fit as well. It felt almost janky after fitting so well with SecUnit's delivery. Still, a nice little addition."

The inevitable twist was pretty predictable, but maybe that's just because I've read too many pessimistic space stories and am suspicious of everything."

Murderbot is just a brilliant character, one who I empathised with from the start, and I want to find out a lot more about. This is a short read and the main criticism seems to be how pricey they are for the length, but I had no criticism in terms of the content. Really enjoyed the setting and how it panned out, looking forward to more."

Omg. Some of the platforming was extremely janky (screw you, slides), and would really have benefitted from some fast travel. Or wayfinding. Or just a better bloody map! Outside of that, grabbed all the achievements and was a fun enough way to pass time."

I started reading it after watching the TV show, and for me it's one of the rare times that the show is better than the book. I found his writing style a slog to get through, the stories were unremarkable, and at no point was I dying to read on. It was also really notable that there's not a single woman (even mentioned in passing) until about 80% in. One appears with a non-speaking part, and then the next is a nagging wife character."
