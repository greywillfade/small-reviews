        thoughts: "Picked this up as part of Game Pass. Story was decent and would have been a solid 'fluff' 3.5 thing to play, but docked points because of the AWFUL interface. Seriously, that map. Omg. Some of the platforming was extremely janky (screw you, slides), and would really have benefitted from some fast travel. Or wayfinding. Or just a better bloody map! Outside of that, grabbed all the achievements and was a fun enough way to pass time."

        thoughts: "I know this is pretty much blasphemy, but I was surprised at how little I enjoyed this book. I started reading it after watching the TV show, and for me it's one of the rare times that the show is better than the book. I found his writing style a slog to get through, the stories were unremarkable, and at no point was I dying to read on. It was also really notable that there's not a single woman (even mentioned in passing) until about 80% in. One appears with a non-speaking part, and then the next is a nagging wife character."

        thoughts: "Flew through this, really easy read as was the first book. Mostly set in space, which I really enjoyed. Liked the character development and greater insight into people's motivations, and how this book continued some really insightful descriptions of topics like privilege. Still found the romantic aspects cringy and clunkily written compared to the rest though!"

        thoughts: "Enjoyed the 'recruit anyone' mechanic up to a point, but mostly played as the spider drone as with previous games. Achievements are utterly, utterly broken, which was frustrating. Otherwise a decent enough game to pass time, and enjoyed visiting parts of London I knew."

        thoughts: "Easy to get into, and enjoyed most of this. Felt it lost its way a bit in Argelo but figured that was part of the pacing. But then the last two chapters just lost me. A bit too weird a payoff, and an unresolved ending that felt like it just gave up. Also Sophie is a dick, and there were tons of weird relationship dynamics that just didn't feel believable or something to get behind."

        thoughts: "Wasn't sure I'd be into it initially as the first chapter or so didn't grab me. However ended up going with it and enjoyed it by the end. Not as \"I must read more\" as previous books by them, but would consider reading a sequel."

        thoughts: "Slow-paced, gentle to verging on dull at points game where you basically press X constantly and read conversations / walk around very slowly. However, I enjoyed getting to know the characters, and the themes of friendship, adulthood, and mental health."

        thoughts: "Fantastic game. So much variety in the level designs (loved the casino minigames, in-book platforming, gameshow... ok all of it). The details were beautiful, and it was also genuinely funny at points. Great story building on but not needing knowledge of 1. Loved it."

        thoughts: "Flew through this book during a week off. Really easy reading, some interesting characters, although wasn't a fan of the really cheesy and sometimes clumsy writing about attraction and sex between the main characters. A lot of the writing on anxiety and prejudice was more deft and resonated. Definitely enough to want to find out what happens next."

        thoughts: "Just... pretentious stupidness. I stuck with it, and it does get better about halfway in. But it tries to be far more clever than it is. Poorly written, you don't understand half of what's going on, don't care about the characters, and reads as never having met a real woman as there are such caricatures."
