        thoughts: "This book has floated around my awareness for ages. I'd seen it on various lists and reviews, and knew the name when it later sat around our house as one of the books my husband bought for a holiday but never read. After all that time, I was disappointed that it was not for me. It starts by describing 'Mrs Flynn the Barman's arse' which got us off on the wrong foot, but I was prepared to put this down to the narration rather than the author. And whilst there's a lot in a similar vein, it wasn't that that did it. \n\nIt took me at least 200 long pages of the overall 582 to remotely get into the story (which actually ends up being reasonably interesting as a concept, if a bit chaotic and all over the place in execution). This book suffers hugely from wild ramblings, in both tangents and style of writing. On one page there's a sentence with 193 words, which sadly isn't an exception. If it was a third of the size and written differently I'd have liked it a lot more. A shame!"

        thoughts: "I'd seen this rated highly by others, and it didn't disappoint. I'd also seen comparisons with Ready Player One, which is nonsense, and extremely lazy. If anything it reminded me more of Halt and Catch Fire. This is a beautifully written book, which perfectly captures all kinds of very human emotions and situations. The plot itself for me felt secondary to the characters, who had wonderful depth and flaws, and who felt very real after spending more and more time reading. At one point there's a very notable event, and I found myself wanting to cheat and look ahead to see if everything turned out ok or not, because I was that invested. For others the video game heavy content will be too much, but for me it was a big draw. Loved it."

        thoughts: "I struggled to give this one a rating. It's a very good book; it's a 4 really. On finishing it I wanted to re-read it to see what references and connections I'd missed now the web had all been laid out for me... except I didn't want to. It's probably the timing, of going into another winter in a pandemic that people have all-but given up on, but this book was just a bit *too* bleak for me right now. Yes, there are also themes of persistence and hope and community, but it won't be those images that stay with me, it'll be the thought of a euthanasia rollercoaster for kids."

        thoughts: "I was given this by a very kind friend on returning home from hospital with my kid. And to be honest, since then I've been a bit scared to start it. When I looked at the title, the 'most awful' part always jumped out, and I was afraid that it'd affirm fears and limitations and upset. But it was in fact quite the opposite. In this collection of essays around motherhood (in all kinds of forms) I unexpectedly found so much resonated, but it was instead reaffirming and gave voice to many things I'd experienced and felt but maybe hadn't had the words for. I wanted to underline things to come back to, but there'd have been so much. It's a book that I'd give someone else, in the hope that they too may take so much from it."

It was a nice easy read with lots of science thought gone into it, which juuust about falls on the side of helpful explanations rather than coming off as just very know it all. I was also actually really enjoying how little of the Everything Constantly Goes Wrong In Space trope it was using... until the book hits a patch of Lots Goes Wrong. Oh well. I enjoyed finding out more through the flashbacks, and generally found it an interesting idea."

        thoughts: "I was lent this by someone who didn't enjoy it, and I took that as a bit of a challenge, thinking it'd suit my tastes better. However this was really not for me either. I didn't get this book at all, which makes me feel like I'm missing something and am stupid, but I found this disjointed, without substance, repetitive, and just bloody confusing. Even after finishing I have absolutely no idea what was going on with the disappearing, which felt utterly out of place in the story about the mother's decline. I read this over a day and a half, during times where I was settling the baby's milk. That's a fast read for me, and it was partly so because I skimmed over so much of the repetitive incoherent babbling sections, and overly elaborate but tedious descriptions. An easily forgettable book."

        thoughts: "This was another Christmas present. It's a standalone book from a universe I haven't read anything else from, but that side was ok apart from the glossary at the start making it feel more daunting than it actually was. I was going to give it 3.5 as the plot was fun and engaging enough, but as I got through the last couple of chapters I decided to downgrade it. For me, there was just too much unnecessary nastiness (mostly gore, but about 4 different explosive shitting scenes), even for an action book. I also wasn't a fan of the entirely unneeded and lazily thrown in rape scene at the start to show a character is A Bad Dude. Plus The Big Reveal at the end was incredibly obvious from much earlier on. And don't get me started on the cliched sex scene. Looking on Goodreads just now the reviews are a series of gushing men, and that's how this book feels ‚Äì a blokey bloke's read."

It contains some content that I found very useful, and which also helped me form up and rationalise some of my thinking and decision making, so in that sense it's been good. But I'll be glad to get back to fiction again!"

Very little happens; it's basically a book detailing conversations between the characters.

It was also nice to get to know Pei a bit better after her previous appearances."

Combat was fun enough but often too chaotic to be properly tactical with getting individuals to lock on to specific targets, and some mechanics were pretty confusing even after finishing.

Given the framing I was hoping there'd be more writing about the city itself, but it was actually pretty limited. Jumps from monster story, to semi-explicit sex fantasies, to family dynamics. Lots of it felt obviously translated, and actually left me wishing it had included the Japanese too, so I could read the originals."

This one breaks with the series and is told from the view of Mensah. It adds an interesting second perspective on a couple of points, but there was something about the writing style and narrative that didn't feel like it fit as well. It felt almost janky after fitting so well with SecUnit's delivery. Still, a nice little addition."

I started reading it after watching the TV show, and for me it's one of the rare times that the show is better than the book. I found his writing style a slog to get through, the stories were unremarkable, and at no point was I dying to read on. It was also really notable that there's not a single woman (even mentioned in passing) until about 80% in. One appears with a non-speaking part, and then the next is a nagging wife character."
