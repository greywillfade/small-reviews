        thoughts: "Easy to get into, and enjoyed most of this. Felt it lost its way a bit in Argelo but figured that was part of the pacing. But then the last two chapters just lost me. A bit too weird a payoff, and an unresolved ending that felt like it just gave up. Also Sophie is a dick, and there were tons of weird relationship dynamics that just didn't feel believable or something to get behind."

        thoughts: "Wasn't sure I'd be into it initially as the first chapter or so didn't grab me. However ended up going with it and enjoyed it by the end. Not as \"I must read more\" as previous books by them, but would consider reading a sequel."

        thoughts: "Slow-paced, gentle to verging on dull at points game where you basically press X constantly and read conversations / walk around very slowly. However, I enjoyed getting to know the characters, and the themes of friendship, adulthood, and mental health."

        thoughts: "Fantastic game. So much variety in the level designs (loved the casino minigames, in-book platforming, gameshow... ok all of it). The details were beautiful, and it was also genuinely funny at points. Great story building on but not needing knowledge of 1. Loved it."

        thoughts: "Flew through this book during a week off. Really easy reading, some interesting characters, although wasn't a fan of the really cheesy and sometimes clumsy writing about attraction and sex between the main characters. A lot of the writing on anxiety and prejudice was more deft and resonated. Definitely enough to want to find out what happens next."

        thoughts: "Just... pretentious stupidness. I stuck with it, and it does get better about halfway in. But it tries to be far more clever than it is. Poorly written, you don't understand half of what's going on, don't care about the characters, and reads as never having met a real woman as there are such caricatures."
