This book reminded me of what it feels like to try to read Japanese novels a bit too far above my level: I kind of get the gist of what's going on, but I couldn't answer questions well on details. Even after finishing this book and getting the 'explainer chapters' at the end, there are fundamental bits I simply don't understand. Apparently I'm not alone, with a ton of people on Goodreads experiencing similar. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to use my imagination, and I don't need it spelled out to me exactly what a servitor, formation instinct, or exotic weapons are exactly. But right from the start the sheer level of never explained terms made the world-building feel weak and disconnected for me. Characters with non-memorable names were thrown in and soon disappear, leading to a lot of 'am I meant to know this name?' too. Despite all that, I did like the central concept, and I'm open to reading more in the series as it sounds like they're a bit more accessible...and maybe will help me put some of the pieces together about this book!
