I was given this by a very kind friend on returning home from hospital with my kid. And to be honest, since then I've been a bit scared to start it. When I looked at the title, the 'most awful' part always jumped out, and I was afraid that it'd affirm fears and limitations and upset. But it was in fact quite the opposite. In this collection of essays around motherhood (in all kinds of forms) I unexpectedly found so much resonated, but it was instead reaffirming and gave voice to many things I'd experienced and felt but maybe hadn't had the words for. I wanted to underline things to come back to, but there'd have been so much. It's a book that I'd give someone else, in the hope that they too may take so much from it.
