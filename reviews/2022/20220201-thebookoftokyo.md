A Christmas present, this collection of short stories varied in how much I enjoyed them, but I didn't absolutely love any. Given the framing I was hoping there'd be more writing about the city itself, but it was actually pretty limited. Jumps from monster story, to semi-explicit sex fantasies, to family dynamics. Lots of it felt obviously translated, and actually left me wishing it had included the Japanese too, so I could read the originals.
