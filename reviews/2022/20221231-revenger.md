Read in a covid haze, I started out feeling like I didn't have much connection to the book and it was going to be a bit of a generic slog. However the character of Fura, along with the people around her, soon changed and became much more interesting. Some of the central concepts and mysteries, like the bones, baubles, and quoins also left enough questions for me to be keen to read more in the series. In the end I enjoyed it, it was a strong read and I was excited to see how it ended.
