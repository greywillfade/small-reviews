I'm just adding this in for posterity because I've been playing it sporadically since it came out, although given its nature I'd never be 'finished'. It's...Overwatch. But without the fun of loot boxes, and the no-fun of buying a season pass to unlock rubbish items I don't actually like. It's still a really fun game, but there's nothing new here.
