An extremely short read, but one that I enjoyed. Binti was a character that I could get behind from the start, and the descriptions of prejudice and difference made me both feel for her, but also helped build the world really quickly. There were a number of new terms and fantastical concepts (a ship that was a giant space prawn!) but unlike the previous book I read, I found it easy to imagine the concepts. I only wish it was a bit longer and extensive, as it felt more like a short story than a novella but I'd definitely be keen to read more.
