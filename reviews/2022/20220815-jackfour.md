This was another Christmas present. It's a standalone book from a universe I haven't read anything else from, but that side was ok apart from the glossary at the start making it feel more daunting than it actually was. I was going to give it 3.5 as the plot was fun and engaging enough, but as I got through the last couple of chapters I decided to downgrade it. For me, there was just too much unnecessary nastiness (mostly gore, but about 4 different explosive shitting scenes), even for an action book. I also wasn't a fan of the entirely unneeded and lazily thrown in rape scene at the start to show a character is A Bad Dude. Plus The Big Reveal at the end was incredibly obvious from much earlier on. And don't get me started on the cliched sex scene. Looking on Goodreads just now the reviews are a series of gushing men, and that's how this book feels â€“ a blokey bloke's read.
