This book has floated around my awareness for ages. I'd seen it on various lists and reviews, and knew the name when it later sat around our house as one of the books my husband bought for a holiday but never read. After all that time, I was disappointed that it was not for me. It starts by describing 'Mrs Flynn the Barman's arse' which got us off on the wrong foot, but I was prepared to put this down to the narration rather than the author. And whilst there's a lot in a similar vein, it wasn't that that did it.

It took me at least 200 long pages of the overall 582 to remotely get into the story (which actually ends up being reasonably interesting as a concept, if a bit chaotic and all over the place in execution). This book suffers hugely from wild ramblings, in both tangents and style of writing. On one page there's a sentence with 193 words, which sadly isn't an exception. If it was a third of the size and written differently I'd have liked it a lot more. A shame!
