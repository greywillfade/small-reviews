Very gentle time-passer where you mostly walk right and play guitar as you go, interspersed by some pattern matching mini games, some dialogue, and a chance to create a wonderfully flamboyant outfit and back-story. Cute little story, known voice actors, but most notable for the absolutely stunning visuals that evolve as you play music.
