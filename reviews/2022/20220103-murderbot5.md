Ahhh so good! This is a longer read than all of the others, and I'm pleased as I loved it all. The pacing is absolutely bang on, I loved the evolving interactions between SecUnit and the ship, but also the introduction of storytelling from different, er, perspectives (no spoilers) brought an interesting but cohesive different dynamic to the story itself. Action, intrigue, amusing parts, humanity, was nothing I didn't like.
