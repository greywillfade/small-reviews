I've been meaning to play this for years. I think I was initially put off by thinking it was scary (it's not) way back, but on seeing it on Game Pass I downloaded it at some point before I got distracted by Overwatch 2. I happened to see it was leaving very soon, and that was the kick I needed to crack on, so I motored through it in a few hours over the last few days. I felt like the wilderness was a bit tedious and empty and this plus some clunky movement didn't make me want to explore, which was a bit of a missed opportunity. However the story was interesting and quite touching at points, and it was compelling enough to want to finish before the deadline.
