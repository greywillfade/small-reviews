I've come to realise that a good signal for my game scores nowadays are whether I have any energy to go back through it to mop up collectibles and achievements on finishing. This was a really enjoyable game, and one where I have gone back... but to a point. I enjoyed the story (although bits were a bit predictable, especially the Molly level), and was happy to run through some of the levels again, as they're beautiful. The sound design was also notable, and the way that each level built up to a song was very special. The game could do with some finessing though.

It's primarily a platform with some fighting sequences, but platforming can be a bit clunky, particularly on ledges or trying to jump across branches. It just didn't feel as smooth as it could have. Equally combat was ok, but didn't have the magic that makes it _fun_. The pacing on getting powers felt odd, as you basically get everything very fast, but then there's points where you have currency to spend and are blocked from any further upgrades, and quite a bit in advance of the end of the game I'd bought everything but were left with tons of surplus to spend. There were some achievements around not taking damage in boss fights, but to replay them you have to do the whooooole level again... which has been my limit.

Good story, visually lovely, great sound, nice mix of settings, but with a bit of clunkiness that lets it down.
