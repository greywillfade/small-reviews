I started playing this game back in _July_, and I'm finally, finally at a point where I think I feel satisfied to put it down. Probably. Even though there's still stuff left to do. This is an unexpectedly incredible game. It had been on my play later list for a long time, in the vibe of "oh hey another light little indie puzzle game to put in between other things", but I'd never picked it up properly because I was being judgemental about what looked a bit like pretty budget artwork. I thought it'd likely be at the level of the Botany Manor or Escape Academy games, but instead I found something that far, far exceeded all of my general expectations for games, and then some.

I was nudged into loading it up because some people were saying how great it was on the work slack, but I knew exceedingly little. And the game is very like that. You know nothing, you have nothing, and you have to slowly, slowly piece everything together. The pacing is perfect – compared to my previous 'proper' game of South of Midnight where powers came in odd waves, this was just so well done. What amazed me the most was just the incredible level of attention to detail, the sheer depth in the world building, and the fact that every time you think you're at the end, you work out another thread to pull which leads you to way more. On multiple occasions I had genuine "oh my goodness what is _this_ now?" moments of excitement when something changed or was revealed.

Some of this is RNG hell for sure, and I did hit more frustrating periods where I was just not getting what I needed. And some of the puzzles are really bloody obtuse and difficult. This definitely isn't a game for everyone: my husband actually started it at the same time, but on seeing me start my (what has ended up being EIGHTY EIGHT (∞ game reference lols, apt) PAGES of) notes, plus an extensive photo album of all my references, he noped out. But if you're into deep story, really detailed puzzles, repetive but layered environments, and really immersing yourself in something, you will hopefully love this. And it gets a perfect score from me.
