Similar to the book situation, I put down the amazingness that was Blue Prince, then dived into Borderlands 4... and got bored. Again, I was working through some difficult stuff so a grindy, Animal Crossing nostalgic, neverending Dreamlight Valley wormed itself into my dopamine centre after my husband started it with our kid. I spent way, way too much time on this. Did I get the return on investment? Absolutely not. Would I recommend it? Absolutely not. It's buggy as hell, and putting out an update which revamps the look and feel of the settings page that includes y axis inversion, whilst simultaneously not fixing the bug that breaks inversion every time you start the game was unforgivable. I finally got the strength to put this down, and I hope I don't get sucked back into the grind if my kid wants to pick it up again later.
