I'd picked this up on the back of a review from someone (thank you whoever it was although I can't remember!). It's historical fantasy, following Zhu as the main character, and covers their journey from starving peasant girl through to... you'll have to find out. The book is drenched in gender identity, sexuality, and queer romance themes, as well as a ton of general identity, morality, and other big topics. Both Zhu and the other big character (who I won't name as it's not immediately apparent) are so well written and have so many arcs and development points. The ending was also not apparent for me. I got to the point where I knew I needed to get the follow-on book but avoided _anything_ as I genuinely wasn't sure how it was all going to end. Some trigger warnings: there's brutality in varying forms, and a lot of other heavy themes right from the start. But it's well worth a read and is one of my favourites from the year so far.
