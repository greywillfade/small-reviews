Person's village is suddenly captured by robots, they meet a cat creature, they work together to get everyone back. I liked the art and the story, but otherwise this felt pretty unremarkable. It's very much a "keep holding the left stick to go right whilst moving past pretty scenes" game, interspersed with very light puzzles. Only a couple of them felt novel, and there were a lot of times where you were having to do the same actions in between the walking, such as many times asking your companion to jump up a ledge and drop down a rope before you could proceed. I think there's a second game coming out next year. I wouldn't be put off playing it, but I'd hope for a bit more.
