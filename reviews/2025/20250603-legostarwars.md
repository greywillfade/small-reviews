What. a. bloody. slog. I'm pretty sure a LEGO game was the first I ever fully 100%ed, got all the achievements on. I played a load of the original LEGO Star Wars ones amongst many others, and I've always found them fun and satisfying... to a point. Every single game that I remember went on just a little bit too long somehow, and this is no exception. The Skywalker Saga covers three trilogies, so right off the bat you're playing 5 or 6 levels _per film_. As with LEGO games in general you shouldn't expect to complete the level the first time around though, as collectables are locked off until you can do it in "free play" with other characters, plus each level has a number of additional mystery challenges. After going through all the levels, I decided to focus on the open world aspect. There are a ridiculous number of characters to unlock, plus kyber crystals to collect (about 1200). I... nearly made it. I got all of the blocks and characters that didn't involve the stupid space "driving through hoops in no pattern against the clock" challenges, because it's no fun waiting for a clock to run down because you've missed a gate and can't restart. I actually felt relief when I thought the game had bugged me out of being able to finish a mission that'd mean completion wasn't possible... but no, I fixed it. Once I'd exhausted everything out of sheer compulsive collection habits, I realised I had zero appetite for doing the levels again and mopping up, so I stopped. This was another game that I only started in the first place because of putting it on to amuse my kid, who then lost interest and left me suckered in. Maybe we'll come back to it at some point, but for now I'm just relieved to be free from my own obligations!
