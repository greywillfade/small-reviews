Another book that I can't remember why I added it to my list, but I didn't know anything about it beyond the blurb on the back. Be warned, this is a book which is basically entirely about an abusive relationship, in which one party happens to be non-human. The guy was a complete dick, and the book contains numerous scenes of emotional and physical sexual abuse and coercive control. Because of that, whilst I read it at a decent pace and was invested, I also wouldn't say that I fully enjoyed it.
