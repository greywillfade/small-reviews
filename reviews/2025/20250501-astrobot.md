I have no idea when I actually put this game down, so the date is somewhat arbitrary, but this is such a great game. It was first introduced as a father/kid amusement - something for my husband to play that wasn't entirely mindless and boring - and the two of them happily played through the levels together, with the kid developing increasingly impressive levels of coordination. At some point however, due to unsupervision the main save got overwritten, and we needed to start again. At that point I stepped in to play through. It was quickly apparent how well designed, how much care and thought had gone in, but most importantly how utterly perfect it was for both both adults and kids. Some levels (the colour/shape ones and speed runs) are genuinely _hard_. Some of the puzzle pieces aren't obvious at all and you really have to search. So there's a ton of replayability as well as it being at a good level for a small child to get their head around how to do it. I enjoyed it so much that I secretly spent some evenings making progress on my own. It was such an obsession for a while (for both of us), that it ended up being the theme of the kid's third birthday cake.
