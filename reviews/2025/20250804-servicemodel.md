A story about a robot valet named Charles, who leaves the confines of his manor house under some less than ideal circumstances, meets another character, and goes on side quests in service of an end goal of fulfilling purpose. This started stronger than it finished for me. I enjoyed the extreme logical nature of the robots throughout the book and where it's all led them, and it made me think of the [PB&J dad](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/dv6xm4/dad_takes_instructions_on_how_to_make_a_pbj/) from a while back. That said, I'd seen the book described as funny, and unlike stupid internet videos it never actually got to that point for me, more just timely and sadly relevant. The latter half, once a certain other major third party gets involved, felt a bit more tedious. It was a bit more rote "go to a thing to fulfil goal, problems arise, repeat", and honestly the ending felt a bit unrewarding. But overall I liked the concept, and it's a future that sadly I could see happening.
