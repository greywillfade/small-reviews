Going in with the 5 for this one. I finished it in a very late night binge when I was staying away, and despite really needing to go to sleep at that point, I stayed up even later looking up real information around the people the book was inspired by. I love the characters, I wasn't happy about a couple of deaths, but that was just in keeping with the way the first book had started out. Everything wrapped up neatly and for me it was a very satisfying arc. This series will definitely be a recommendation, and a potential reread in the future.
