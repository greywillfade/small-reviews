Once I got into this book I realised I remembered most of it, which was nice as I think the first read through was more stressful! It rounds off the whole arc nicely, and I think is probably (maybe?) my second favourite of the first books. I really love all of the development that we've seem from SecUnit, more of the relationship with the primary human the plot if focused around, but also the other nice moments (e.g. the interaction with G when waking up) and callbacks (GI offer at the end).

There was no question of just wrapping up the read at the end of this boxset as I'm not nearly bored yet, and I was relieved when I managed to find the next book easily in my stash.
