Yep, you read that right, 3 months has passed without a book. After finishing all the Murderbots I actually had the biggest pile of books to dive into that I've had in a while... but none of them actually called to me to start them. In particular, one was work-related, and coming off the back of redundancy and making myself focus on _not working_, plus some other life challenges, I just kind of stopped reading. 

This was a Christmas present, a short graphic novel, and I figured it was the perfect thing to break the duck. I've been struggling with some night waking and insomnia, so I definitely need books in my life, but sadly it won't be this as I've flown through it so quickly. It packs a lot of story and worldbuilding into its 100 pages, but ultimately I was left searching to see if there was a sequel (there is not). It's not that the ending was disappointing, it's more that there were so many threads still open and it felt like a bit of missed potential to not explore some of those elements. I think because of that it was enjoyable but won't be long-lastingly memorable.
