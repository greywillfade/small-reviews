I _think_ this may be my first re-read since keeping track of my books, and I scored this before I'd looked back at my previous review. The re-read was prompted by a (slightly reluctant) watching of the AppleTV 'Murderbot' series, which I've been side-eyeing ever since I found out Murderbot had been cast as a very manly man (which is obviously completely wrong). It had been years (Dec 21!) since I first read the book, and I found myself going "ehhh, this doesn't feel right" in places at the show, and so picked up the book to be able to do that annoying comparison thing. Despite some changes, there is a lot that is actually very faithful in terms of dialogue, but the show just doesn't match what I had in my head in loads of ways. So despite me having an enormous pile of things ready to read, I've embarked on a full re-read because I couldn't just stop at 1 book. I'm finding myself already bringing in some of the TV visuals, which is annoying, but I'm really hoping it will fade as I read on.

One of the interesting asides about reading is that I've noticed Murderbot speaks with as many brackets as I end up with typing, which is very relatable in terms of inner voice. 

Anyway, loved this again, and really looking forward to fully immersing myself in the whole wonderful story to come.
