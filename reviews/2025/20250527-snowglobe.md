At work we have a book exchange, and on finishing Nimona at lunch I decided to flick through and grab something to tide me over on the train ride home. Snowglobe stood out as an interesting dystopian concept: the planet is totally screwed, everyone lives in -50Â°, apart from the 'lucky' actors and directors who live in Snowglobe. There, they enjoy what we'd consider normal temperatures and a generally luxurious lifestyle, apart from the fact that to live there they have to make or star in the reality shows that the rest of the world watch obsessively.
The plot does get rather fantastical in parts, so it's definitely not entirely a gritty take on climate and societal themes, and I think some people like it less for the silly bits. However for me it was fun, was pretty well paced, had decent characters, and kept my interest. 

On finishing I saw that it was part of a duology, and as luck would have it the second book was released two days after I finished this one. I immediately ordered it and am looking forward to wrapping everything up.
