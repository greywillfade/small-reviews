Yayyyy ART. I'd missed it. Going back to the TV show, absolutely whatever they do with ART if they do other series will be wrong, and so I feel like I definitely can't watch any more. But that's fine when the books are this good. I think ART was my main highlight in this story, and knowing what I do now, I'm glad that it's (mild spoiler for non-me readers) not the last we see of it.

I again haven't read back my previous thoughts on this one, but I feel like the RaviHyral storyline, whilst very important in terms of back story, wasn't a really rewarding payoff for either Murderbot or us. In hindsight it feels a bit similar to the DeltFall storyline, but with the exception of the ComfortUnit element, which obviously does mesh in nicely with the thread about the one in this book. They're an interesting type of unit, and one that SecUnit obviously doesn't relate to hugely, but I enjoyed the arc both units went through.

The humans I could take or leave, and compared to other humans in the books these ones all blended into one a bit. But that's ok when the bots have so much personality!

One interesting bit, again with my grumpiness around the TV show in mind, was that SecUnit deliberately chooses a non-gender specific pronoun when it has to meet its clients. I had this as some nice mental validation againt the TV presentation because as much as I'm all for people having whatever pronouns and presenting however they wish... there was no way the TV show would do anything other than he/him. So again, +1 point for the books and reinforcing my mental image.
