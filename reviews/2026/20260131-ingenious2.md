This was my favourite book in the series. We get some more children with very different backgrounds introduced, a mission into the jungle, medical issues, and a new baddie. 

The animals feature even more in this one, with whole sections dedicated to their perspectives, which can sometimes go on a bit long. There's again a lot of death and nasty things happening, so it's not an entirely happy read, but again really quite captivating and easy to get through.
