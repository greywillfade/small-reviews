This is one of those mythical books I semi-guiltily felt like I should have read a long time ago, because it's a "work book" disguised as a novel. Should I have read it a long time ago? Meh, maybe, and I may have learnt a bit more from it had I done so...but I may also have picked up some bad habits. The story is ok, the concepts it shares are relatable and recognisable, but the writing and characters are not great. The culture in the company is undoubtedly toxic on so many levels, and whilst the book's trying to share a lot of wisdom, I feel it inadvertently ends up pushing other messages too through some blind spots. My litmus test is usually "do I want to read more in the series?" and in this instance I'll probably skip it.
