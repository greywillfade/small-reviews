I've procrastinated on this book for a long time. It was a read I picked up from my office's book exchange before I left, so I'd probably had it since August. At the time I picked it up for a fluffy train read (genius teenagers with abilities, nature), but then the YA perception actually ended up putting me off it when I was struggling to pick up books. 

Although this has been labelled online as YA, the whole series is pretty bloody dark. The opening chapter deals with the attempted murder of a young child, and there's a lot of that level of thing. There are a lot of characters, but they're all individual and really well done. The plot is captivating and flows well, and it was a really engaging read. I enjoyed how the animals also get their own perspective, although again you need to be ok with animal death. The themes of ethics, natural world/climate change, religion, relationships, and technology crop up throughout. And whilst this wasn't my favourite book in the series I immediately bought the next one as I was enjoying the world.
