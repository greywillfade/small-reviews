This was a game that became less fun as it went on. It felt repetitive, clunky in lots of ways, and didn't have any of the fluidity of the combat of the original games. The bonus challenges in particular left me so cold, having to adapt a fighting style to whatever the requests were rather than what suited my character or the situation. Plot-wise I'd read Court of Owls lines and enjoyed them, but this somehow missed the mark. And somehow, one of my favourite things normally – collectible hunting – was just really tedious and not fun? That said, I still sunk (way too much) time into it, and actually found myself more drawn to the (still extremely repetitive and grindy) hoarde mode after a while once I figured out you could match with people. Not one I'd recommend, but still a passable time sink.
