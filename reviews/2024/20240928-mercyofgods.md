Thinking back over the plot of this book, it was pretty... ok very...bleak! There's a lot of difficult topics, the sometimes unexpected death of quite a lot of characters (they're at it again!), a character with mental health challenges, violence, living as prisoners and all that comes with that... and that's without basically losing an entire planet. But as with The Expanse, there's an ensemble cast who all find solace in each other, and who you grow to know more about as the book goes on. Similarly to the Expanse, it jumps from the perspective of different characters, so you get a nice bit of variety in the stories. There's a load of action, the worldbuilding is great, and there's clearly enough interesting plotlines to keep us readers busy in future.

I flew through this hefty book, and really enjoyed it all. My main issue was it was a hardback (I bloody hate hardbacks), but will definitely look forward to more. I just hope I don't forget all of the nuances in between now and whenever the next one will be out.
