I downloaded this on a total whim after finishing my last game and wanting something with low commitment to pass a lunch break during a draining period at work. I remembered playing Goat Simulator, without actually remembering much about it. From my profile history it looks like I played it in 2016 and got some achievements but clearly gave up at some point, which is what I was expecting from this one. But you know what? I actually thought this was great!

In contrast to Gotham Knights, where the collectibles were just not fun at all, this is a really well designed game. Janky as hell, but embraces that wholeheartedly, but really well designed. It's just _fun_. I used some guides to mop up some bits towards the end that I couldn't find on my own, but I spent so much time just exploring and playing around to see what I could make happen. I loved the secrets, and the "huh, that would be fun/silly to do" mentality leading to triggering stupid and satisfying events. The map's big, but not _too_ big, and was easy to get around with fast travel / wings and rocket boots or the helmet. The collectables are pretty easy to see from afar, and make a helpful noise when close. Maybe it says something about me and my sense of humour, but I feel like I was on completely the same wavelength as this game, and it perfectly hit the brief for what I was after.
