Cute, pretty, gentle gaming, watercolours, slightly clunky controls, and a backstory/mystery that doesn't hold much weight. A nice enough little filler game, but I couldn't be bothered to go back and play through levels to pick up all the collectibles and achievement hunt, as it was just a bit _too_ slow for me.
