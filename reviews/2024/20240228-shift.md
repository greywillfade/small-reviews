As with Wool, I vividly remember exactly where I was when I originally read this. I remember how jarring but also exciting it was to learn more about the "why" of it all â€“ what had led up to the silos, how they fit in, and a bit about the tech behind it all. Outside of that, I only remembered fragments throughout my re-read this time. 

I really enjoyed having more in the Wool universe and continuing the story (which is still great), but a combination of much less of Jules and her gang coupled by some quite unlikeable characters in the from the historical elements made me generally less invested in their stories. But still a great read and a very enjoyable addition, just not up there with the first.
