This was a chunky book which managed to keep my attention throughout. It's action packed â€“ at some points I felt a bit _too_ action packed and relentlessly paced, but I really enjoy the author's writing and the character development. If I'd read this purely as part of the Lady Astronaut series, I would have really enjoyed it. As it was, I really enjoyed it, but there's a "but". A few months ago I read another book by the same author. Also set in space. Also a mystery. Also featuring a priviledged white woman who has personal trauma and disability. They're not the same, but there was enough overlap for it to stick in my mind and be somewhat distracting somehow. Still, I really enjoyed seeing some of the 'other' characters apart from Elma be brought to life from this series, the story was fun, and it all wrapped up pretty nicely.
