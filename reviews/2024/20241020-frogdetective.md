I'll be honest... this was the first thing in a long time that I couldn't face finishing. So this review is based on playing 2/3 of the 'games' within this collection. The premise was up my street: a detective who's a frog, solving mysteries, and a cute indie game. But in reality it felt like a school project or something – barely any gameplay, which basically consists of tedious dialogue that animates in even when you press the skip button, and walking around slowly on very linear one-step fetch quests. I know it's probably meant to be funny, or at the least quirky and endearing, but I just found it all extremely tedious. I feel a bit mean because I know this is not a high-budget game, and it feels like a stupid project between friends that found its way out into the world which is admirable, but... yeah. Not good.
