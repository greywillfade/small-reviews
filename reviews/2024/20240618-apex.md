A fitting end to the Nexus trilogy, this one picked up after I was less connected to the second. The ensemble cast is still fairly big, but you're much more invested in everyone at this point, and things keep moving forward at every stage. The underlying political tensions are obviously very familiar, but even more so in an election year. Maybe I was just used to the author's style at this point, but looking back this book also feels a lot less clunky in places than the first one did. It all wraps up satisfyingly, and with a nice epilogue to boot.
