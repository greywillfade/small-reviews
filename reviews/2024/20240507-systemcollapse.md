Wah. I was _so_ looking forward to coming back into Murderbot world – something that I've truly loved experiencing – but this was just a bit of a let down. It was enjoyable enough, a short and easy read, and I still very much love Murderbot and ART and the world. But. Hmm.

The first and biggest issue was that this isn't a 'new' story, it takes over directly from the end of the current-day storyline and is unapologetic and actually quite unhelpful with that. And what I mean by that is that the latest of the timeline was occurring in Murderbot 5, Network Effect, which was originally published in 2020 but which I read in January 2022. After that book-wise was Murderbot 6, Fugitive Telemetry, published April 2021 (I finished it 8 days after Network Effect), but in this the plot jumps back in time to before the events of book 5. So when it's come to this latest one, my memory was years out of date, and I hadn't even read the books when they were first published. I read a synopsis, I could remember the main plot points, but honestly I was so fuzzy on who everyone was, why I should care about them, what their characteristics were etc, plus all the nuances of how events had played out any Murderbot was so traumatised. This book doesn't explain anything really, and it's written as if you're picking it up immediately on the back of book 5 and will understand it all in that context. So for me that introduced a real gap in connection, but I'm curious to know if I'd feel differently after re-reading 5 (which I utterly loved).

That said, I don't think the story was very strong in this book generally. Murderbot is learning to deal with their mental health and isn't in a great place for various reasons, which was an interesting development. But the story about the colony just lacked much depth or interest for me outside of AdaCol2, and possibly this would have been better as the first half of another longer book. I still love you, Murderbot, but this wasn't my favourite.
