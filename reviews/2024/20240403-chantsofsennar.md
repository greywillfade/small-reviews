I really, really liked this game. I first came across it on my company's videogames Slack channel as a recommendation, but subsequently saw it on [Sophie](https://localghost.dev/games/)'s list of favourites and I trust her judgement a lot. All I really knew about it coming in was that it needed you to decipher language, and I was pleasantly surprised by the pacing, the difficulty, the puzzles and generally working out what different things were needed. The levels feel big and confusing, but once you can read a bit there are signs and other pointers that help you get around. This game really spoke to my inner language learner, and I loved realising the differences in sentence structure and constructs like different approaches to  pluralisation and negatives. Loved it, and would happily recommend and play it again one day.
