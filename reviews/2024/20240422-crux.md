It took me absolutely ages to get through this one. It's a fairly chunky book at 624 pages, but for some reason I didn't find it quite as captivating as the last one. It's more of the same action action action, but the cast expands out even more and there were several storylines to follow, which meant that you spend a lot of time on things happening in parallel rather than everything moving forward. It wasn't a slog to read, but it did get a bit samey. I'll finish the trilogy for sure, but I'm not desperate to do so as my next read.
