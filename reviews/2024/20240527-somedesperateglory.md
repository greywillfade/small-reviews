This was a birthday present bought for me because apparently it would be up my street, and so once again I went into a book knowing absolutely nothing beyond the blurb. This one is _"A thrillingly told queer space opera about the wreckage of war, the family you find, and who you must become when every choice is stripped from you"_, and yes, it was indeed very much up my street. There's some interesting character arcs for basically almost everyone, the core cultural setting has layers and depth, and the human/alien dynamics were also nicely thought through. I really enjoyed the way that Emily wrote it, and would definitely be keen to read more from her in the future.
