I started this on a bit of a whim because it'd been in my queue, and it didn't grab me. I played a couple of rounds and then went out to do some gardening. It was one of those games that needed a bit of finesse with specific combos, and I wasn't very good at it. It could have gone either way after that, but I decided to play another couple of rounds, and I got a bit better. And... oh... it's one of _those_ games that you actually have to practice and have some skill with rather than button mashing and just wading in with guns eh?! 

Once I got my head round this alien concept, I found myself noticably improving, which was... shock horror... satisfying. At points I turned on some of the accessibility settings, but then was later able to complete the levels without them as I got better. 

I finished it fairly quickly in the end, and initially started going back and ticking off challenges and achievements, but then after a certain point it lost the appeal. There's a tiny bit of story wodged in around the game, but ultimately it did get just a bit too repetitive to be 100%able for me. But fun enough while it lasted.
