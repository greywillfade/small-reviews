I've played all of the Dragon Age games, and have enjoyed them all without them ever _quite_ hitting the emotional highs of the first DA or Mass Effect. I think a good example of this was that I remembered Varric, but I _didn't_ remember Harding, and had to do a bit of a brush up about what I should know from the previous games. Despite that I played this relentlessly, put a huge amount of hours in quite quickly (which was also related to an incredibly stressful family situation and coping mechanisms ðŸ™ƒ), and did really enjoy it. The level of polish really stood out to me, everything from the extremely satisfying gold pick-up animation, through to details like how you don't have to have your companion in the party to use their powers, or ladders being put at annoying places you'll probably fall down (the platforming does suck a bit). I also really enjoyed the characters, the story, and and I did agonise about the classic Bioware decisions forced on me so it definitely left an impression.
