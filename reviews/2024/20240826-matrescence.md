This is a book that I feel compelled to talk to people about. I've made three recommendations about it already, and have been tempted to buy some copies and leave it in places where people who it could resonate with may find it. I came across it through Bec, who wrote this [incredibly powerful review](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-zgYMhsB3p/). I'd been procrastinating on starting a new book, it sounded like it would resonate, and so I picked it up. And despite it being non-fiction, I was hooked. 

This is an unashamedly opinionated, feminist book, which whilst it goes out of its ways to be inclusive, is firmly rooted in the author's experiences. Except those experiences resonate SO much with me, and seemingly with tons of other people. It put into words things I'd felt, and helped me to see someone else sharing the same things. 

The author comes from a background of nature, and some of her writing is a bit _too_ flowery for me. But it's also beautiful, impactful, and articulate. 

Absolutely recommended for anyone in the parenting space, or generally for anyone who wants to understand better what people going through that journey are experiencing.
