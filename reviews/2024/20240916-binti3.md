This one really kicked up a notch, and was pretty action packed. It had some of the same clunkiness as before, but overall felt better paced and was a pretty satisfying ending, mostly tying up the threads. I liked the way the story was told with The Root, with the way that Binti came to terms with her new identity(ies), and by the end of all of this she was a character I could really get behind.  

I did however struggle a bit with a score for this, because whilst I really enjoyed it, I also didn't feel like it was an absolute classic. It'll probably fade away over time from my brain. So I've gone for 4, but really it was more 3.75 when compared to the previous book.
