I'd seen this in my Game Pass list and had made a snarky comment about how a game about unpacking boxes probably wasn't for me, give I still have some unpacked from my last move years ago. A friend's comment on twitter made me think I should give it a go, and I'm glad I did. A lovely, gently, meditative little game with a cute story you interpret pretty much for yourself.
