The first of my enormous end of year learning budget book pile. Something about the tone of this book meant I couldn't get into it, and despite being a subject matter that I actually really care about and agree with it left me cold. Don't get me wrong, the examples called out are definitely a societal cause for concern, and in that sense the book hit its goals. But it felt a bit like chapter after chapter complaining about bad (which could have done with a change of pace) without showcasing positive applications, or suggestions for good. It felt quite black and white in thinking, some of the phrasing was clearly judgy against things that didn't align with the author's stances, and actually a bit... luddite... in terms of some framing. It wasn't until the final few pages that there was any future thinking or solutions, and even then it was the author's opinion rather than evidence based or showing interesting examples of practical frameworks etc. It's also very American-centric, and one page refers to"the British city of Kent" ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Not one I'd recommend to people wanting to learn more about data science, either within the industry or probably even from the general public.
