I needed something short and gentle after the slog of Starfield, and decided to pick up Jusant after stumbling across a short review on Mastodon. It hit the brief perfectly. Meditatively climbing up beautiful scenery, cute (huggable) companion, collectables, and... space whales. Not spectacular, but a very relaxing and quaint exploration.
