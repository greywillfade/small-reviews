Another book my husband never finished and I eventually nicked. He'd bought three in the series and there was enough in this to move on to them at some point, but it wasn't a classic for me. It felt a bit clunky to read at points, in the way that translated things often do, but I appreciated the translator's postscript saying that 'the reader sees a glimpse of another culture's pattern of thinking, hears an echo of another language's rhythms and cadences, and feels a tremor of another people's gestures and movements'. The strange in-game scenes reminded me of something else but I can't remember what, and I enjoyed flicking between that and the real world with everything explained by the end, but I did find some of the science a bit hard to wrap my tired brain around at points. Still, some interesting concepts and I'll read on.
