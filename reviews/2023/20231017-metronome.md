I inherited this book from my husband without knowing anything about it, as I'd finished my previous one and he'd done with this. It's unsettling without being too creepy, detailed whilst still leaving a lot to your imagination, and paces some of the reveals just right. The characters were certainly memorable. The ending felt a bit unsatisfying, but also right I guess, and a lot of the mysteries are deliberately left unsolved. The book does touch on baby loss and sexual assault so be warned on that front, but otherwise I really enjoyed this.
