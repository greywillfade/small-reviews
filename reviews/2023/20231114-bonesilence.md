All in all, this was a fun trilogy. I shouldn't have doubted the concept of space pirates, I guess. The mysteries helped it along, and this one ended with most things answered (if not everything, and still with some plot holes and gaps), and wrapped up the stories of the sisters. There was a lot of death (maybe a bit too much?), but it was still in the same fluffy vein as the others whilst also being quite memorable.
