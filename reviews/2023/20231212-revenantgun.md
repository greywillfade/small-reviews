I need to reconcile it against my Expanse experince to be sure, but I think this may actually be my favourite thing I read this year... which was entirely unexpected. This nicely wrapped up the trilogy, and as with the previous book it both explained a lot and was much, much more accessible than the first. I enjoyed that we also got the perception of non-human entities (no spoilers) in a few chapters, and that the ending, whilst not entirely _happy_ did tie everything up pretty well, especially given all the mess that things were in by then! This was a complex, really different universe with so much to learn about, but ultimately ended up being really quite memorable.
