Another short little gentle time-passer. You can tell I'm both waiting for a big game (hello Starfield) and not enjoying my current book by the way I'm procrastinating with these!

Blasphemy to some, but I've never actually played a Monkey Island game before, or if I did, I don't remember it. Despite that I didn't feel like there was too much to miss, but also it wasn't _that_ good, so maybe I am missing something key. The puzzles of the last two games I've played were much more satisfying (although I was only on Casual), and I found some of the traipsing back and forward a bit tedious. But it was... fine. Solid three stars for me.
