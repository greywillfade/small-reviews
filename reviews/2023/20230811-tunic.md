I completely stumbled across this game. I was in the Rewards screen, it offered me some meagre points to play this, and because isometric foxes are up my street I gave it a shot on cloud gaming. I knew nothing about it and was intrigued. There's no tutorial, you pick up pages of an instruction manual as you go along, but most of it is written in the game's made-up language so you're basically left to work out what to do and how to do it.

I played it for a little bit as intended, but the exploration and puzzle solving was by far the most interesting part, and the clunky combat just felt like it was getting in the way and slowing me down too much. After that I used the accessibility settings (hooray!) to turn on invincibility and endless stamina, which allowed me to focus on the many, many mysteries rather than getting annoyed at having to get past hard enemies when I just wanted to retraverse the map. Despite invincibility, I still managed to die twice from hitting kill spots in the environment ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

For a game that's all about working things out yourself, it can be surprisingly unforgiving. For example, you pick up things from chests that you have no idea what they are, including how rare. I ended up speculatively trying a few, but then hoarded most things because I had no idea if or when I could get more. I wasted items like bombs and potions from trying them out, and I smashed a money box in battle when I was thinking it could be a more helpful item. I had invincibility turned on later on, but after falling into an arena and not knowing what it was, I accidentally triggered the only health reset before summoning enemies. I won't say anything about the ending, but I accidentally triggered it when searching for something else, leading to a whoooole lot of confusion and some grumpiness before I went back again armed with internet knowledge. Approach your explorations the wrong way, and this can be a HARD game.

Despite all that, and playing it toned down... I really enjoyed it. There is a ton of depth if you're after it, and some of the fights would be big challenges if you want them to be. I never ever would have finished a load of the puzzles without guides, and I have serious respect for people who have gone deep into this game. However I really enjoyed the gorgeous visuals, slow reveal of the instruction booklet, the exploration, puzzle solving, and general having to work out what my goals were. And as always, big props for accessibility settings that let everyone customise their own experience.
