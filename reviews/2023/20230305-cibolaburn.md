This one was definitely a bit more of a slog. It continued to have fewer of the core team narrating chapters, the on-planet bits really dragged, and for large chunks of the book both Elvi and Basia were pretty annoying. However, I did enjoy both Basia and Havelock being a continuation of previous appearances, unlike in the TV show. Still very enjoyable, but I'm hoping for a bit more excitement and a bit less moping and mud in the next book.
