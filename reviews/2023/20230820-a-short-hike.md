Very cute little gentle game, which is basically Animal Crossing plus loot and mountain climbing. It's very short, although I enjoyed doing all the side quests and mopping up all the collectibles. I don't have much to say about it apart from the (minimal) story and dialogue were sweet, the view from the top was pretty, and it was a nice thing to dip into on a few baby breaks.
