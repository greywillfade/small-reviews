I haven't been able to _finish_ finish this as I'm a victim of the bounty hunting never triggering properly, and am eagerly awaiting Patch 6 so I can clean that and the last two achievements up. But I loved this. I was recently asked why I only gave the previous game 3 stars, which made me look back. And they've basically fixed all of the things that annoyed me before. Ok, so the first time I had to fly a birdthing I found it incredibly unintuitive, some of the platforming was still janky, but there was so much to love that I could put that aside this time. The big, open worlds were a joy. The huge amount of collectables were right up my street, coupled with being marked on the map to mop up at just the right pacing. The map is actually useful! There is fast travel! Riding things! The story was great, and I actually spoiled it for myself because I now really like Merrin and I was getting worried she may not be ok. Some of the force tears were wickedly hard, but I managed them with some persistence. Really great game, can't wait for more.
