I think I'm getting a bit Expansed out now. I still enjoyed this one, but felt like I was running out of steam a bit. The sheer range of characters who took point on chapters made this almost feel like a collection of short stories, as some of them were real nobodies who never got another chance to narrate, just popping up in other characters' goes. That said, I did actually enjoy that we got to see a bit from the Free Navy on Medina's perspective of how it all went down. Seeing Filip develop was also interesting to read, and I enjoyed how him and Marco read slightly differently to the other characters.
