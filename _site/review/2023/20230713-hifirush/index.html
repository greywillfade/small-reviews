<p>Another game that's finished-but-not-finished as there's a zillion achievements and I may mop some more up, but my enthusiasm is waning a bit now as there's just too many to get through. This was a fun little game which was very up my street in terms of puns, silly references, and 4th wall breaking. I laughed when Left Shark made an appearance, but it was even better to get to add that as my costume. Gameplay and story-wise it was very enjoyable if a bit repetitive, and the main things that let it down for me were mostly technical niggles: not having a way to calibrate the audio, the music being really monotonous and samey at times, wishing I could replay just individual fights rather than 1h+ entire levels, achievements not stacking, general collectables being locked behind some bloody hard SPECTRA doors, and needing at least 5 full play throughs just to be able to get everything is silly. But it's a silly game, and I forgive it purely on the basis of the 'kenkyuu very much' pun in the Japanese audio.</p>
