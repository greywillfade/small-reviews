<p>This was the first book where I didn't know what was going to happen, and it was somewhat strange and exciting because of it. The time leap threw me off â€“ everyone's suddenly got older and I felt a bit of a sense of disconnection, but I guess that's what all the novellas are for (I haven't read any yet as I don't really like e/audiobooks). Despite that, this was a meaty story with lots going on on different fronts, and it feels like it put a lot of time into setting up the last couple of books. It's definitely left everything on a bit of a cliffhanger. Lots of action, lots of political wranglings and lessons, and lots of &quot;oh just one more chapter then&quot;s.</p>
