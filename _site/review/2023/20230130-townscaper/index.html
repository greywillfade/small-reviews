<p>This had been in my backlog for ages, and I finally downloaded it when looking for something throwaway that I could pick up and put down quickly whilst the baby napped. This was perfect, it was very cute and surprisingly fun. You're chucked straight in, no guide to the controls, and no explanation. Initially I found some frustration with things like not realising the grid wasn't straight... but soon that changed into &quot;oh cool, it did <em>that</em>!&quot;. What you build, and how that relates to the structures and grid around it means you get little delighters, like buildings changing into a lighthouse, or washing being hung out between two towers. I loved that birds settled on my wooden struts and roof of another large building. I played longer than I expected, and really enjoyed the gentle exploration it encouraged.</p>
