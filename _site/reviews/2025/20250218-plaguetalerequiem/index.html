<p>This review is complicated and is going to have to be a bit spoiler-ful, so for anyone else reading this please bear that in mind.</p>
<p>I've had this in my play later list for absolutely ages. I think it may actually have switched over from the first game (APT: Innocence) at some point, but that said it wasn't until chapter 2 or so that I realised there <em>was</em> a previous game. I just thought the explanations were slow in coming ðŸ™„</p>
<p>I'd originally been attracted because something about the art made me think this was a Dishonored spin-off (which it very much isn't), and then later put off because I thought it was a Dishonored rip off (which it also isn't).</p>
<p>Despite that, and not being gripped by it for a while, this ended up as a really moving, weirdly captivating story that left me actually emotional. It was extra surprising considering I didn't enjoy the voice acting for Amicia at all, but I actually came to care for the central characters a lot. However, I'm actually glad I hadn't played the first game, because I would be even more <em>pissed</em> at how it all ends up.</p>
<p>This is not a happy game. It's bleak as hell, in both the story and the vast numbers of dead bodies and all round disgustingness. It gives hope, then takes it away, then repeats, and part way through I considered stopping just because I could see where it was all going and didn't want that.</p>
<p>This is also the hardest game I've ever played on story mode. I switched over at one point after getting frustrated with a set piece that restarted with a cut scene, and yet I died <em>a lot</em>. I'm not generally a fan of stealth games and forced fleeing-from-stressful-things sequences and slow walking times, and there's plenty of all. So gameplay wise I didn't absolutely love it, story wise I respected but didn't enjoy the ending, but it was a powerful game that will really stay with me. And at some point if I want to torture myself I may get the first one. I settled on 3.5, but it was between that and 4.</p>
