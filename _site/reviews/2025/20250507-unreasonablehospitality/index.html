<p>I was fortunate to get this book from work, and even more so as it was part of an event where the author held a session to speak to us about applying the concepts. As I've mentioned before, I usually struggle to prioritise non-fiction, but I was going away to a conference and shockingly realised I didn't have anything else lined up, so it was a good push to pick this up. I'm glad I did, as I do really enjoy stories about restaurants, stories about people doing things differently to the norm, and practical takeaways that I can apply to work. The book itself is a mix of personal memoir, history of the restaurant, and business advice book. Because of that, it never fully leans into any genre. For the latter, I felt it could have done with a clear summary of the takeaways, and overall once you got the idea there is a bit of repetition to hit home the points. So an enjoyable and easy read, and one that has left a lasting impression and inspiration, but I'm now back to the sci-fi ðŸ˜‰</p>
