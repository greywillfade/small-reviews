<p>I <em>think</em> this may be my first re-read since keeping track of my books, and I scored this before I'd looked back at my previous review. The re-read was prompted by a (slightly reluctant) watching of the AppleTV 'Murderbot' series, which I've been side-eyeing ever since I found out Murderbot had been cast as a very manly man (which is obviously completely wrong). It had been years (Dec 21!) since I first read the book, and I found myself going &quot;ehhh, this doesn't feel right&quot; in places at the show, and so picked up the book to be able to do that annoying comparison thing. Despite some changes, there is a lot that is actually very faithful in terms of dialogue, but the show just doesn't match what I had in my head in loads of ways. So despite me having an enormous pile of things ready to read, I've embarked on a full re-read because I couldn't just stop at 1 book. I'm finding myself already bringing in some of the TV visuals, which is annoying, but I'm really hoping it will fade as I read on.</p>
<p>One of the interesting asides about reading is that I've noticed Murderbot speaks with as many brackets as I end up with typing, which is very relatable in terms of inner voice.</p>
<p>Anyway, loved this again, and really looking forward to fully immersing myself in the whole wonderful story to come.</p>
