<p>I'm writing this way after the fact (more on that in a sec) as I forgot to update this. So obviously I've forgotten most of what I would have said at the time. I do however remember really enjoying this one again, even though I remembered the outcome of the &quot;whodunnit&quot; element. It's a really solid story an enjoyable read within the overall series; standalone enough for it to be readable out of order, but does definitely add something in.</p>
