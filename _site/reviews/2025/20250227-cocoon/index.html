<p>Another Annapurna game, another novel little puzzler. This is another 'no dialogue, no instructions' game, and it's well done with that. The concept is interesting, where you're jumping around between spheres you can carry, but which are equally worlds to jump into (similar but different to playing with size in Maquette). There's a vague story/premise, but for me didn't add much. The puzzles were at a pretty basic level most of the way through, but there were a couple before the end that I did have to think through a bit more rather than it feeling pretty on rails. Overall a nice light little game.</p>
