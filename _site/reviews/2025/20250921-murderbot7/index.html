<p>May 2024 me wrote &quot;I'm curious to know if I'd feel differently after re-reading 5&quot;, after giving this book a 3/5. And I do! I deliberately read this out of book order so it could lead straight on. Everything was much more fresh in my mind, but it's interesting that whilst I worried about not remembering characters, actually these are mostly 'new to us' characters that we hadn't got to know properly in detail. Apart from Ratthi. It still did feel pretty slow though, and I know that Murderbot doesn't want to, but I would have liked to have gone more into the [redacted] stuff once Murderbot opens up a bit about what happened. It actually felt like the build up to the [redacted] reveal had much more performance issue stuff, but afterwards things were actually pretty ok (but I may already be misremembering). Anyway, I do really like the concept of the [redacted] stuff and I hope that we get more of the aftermath or resolution in a future book.</p>
<p>Still not one of my favourites, but definitely better reading it directly after 5.</p>
