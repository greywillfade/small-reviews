<p>In contrast to my previous review, this was another &quot;put it on to amuse the kid&quot; (look there's been a lot of days off nursery and rainy days recently, ok!) game, but it had also been on my Play Later list for ages. And I looooved it. Right from the opening sequence, you're a cat. Who's in a Japanese city. Complete with Yamanote Line train. And custom stylised manhole covers. And authentic sounds. And stuff to collect all over the map. And you can buy gacha from machines that give you different cat hats. And you go on a not-quite-untitled-goose-game or goat simular level set of quests with whimsy and naughtiness. Whimsical animal chaos is up there with my favourite game genres. It's basically a big mishmash of things that I like, and is very cute with it.</p>
<p>The only reason I'm marking down points is because the key mechanic (climbing) is extremely clunky. If the running and climbing had been more fluid, it would have felt much more polished and satisfying. And the other thing was not having a proper jingle when going in the konbini. Missed opportunity. Aside from those, stellar concept.</p>
