<p>I picked this one up after flicking through the Hugo awards 2024 listing, and I'm really glad I did. Amina is a sweary, 40-something, mother and retired pirate with a dodgy knee. Immediately relatable. The writing really spoke to me individually, and I found myself taking photos of passages like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure I ever stopped being a nakhudha,&quot; I finally replied. &quot;Our heards may be spoken for by those with sweet eyes, little smiles, and so <em>very many</em> needs, but that does not mean that which makes us <em>us</em> is gone. And I hope...part of me hopes anyway that in seeing me do this, Marjana knows more is possible. I would not want her to believe that because she was born a girl, she cannot dream.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When she spoke again, her voice was contemplative. &quot;After my first husband died, I used to go to my father's office in town once a week to check the books. I am better with numbers than my siblings, but it was boring, mindless work. And yet I loved it. The chance to be alone for a few hours and accountable only to myself To have lunch on the beach and watch the waves come in without anyone needing me. It was a respite I did not realize until I married a second time and Ahmad was born. I love my children with my whole heart, but...&quot; She met my gaze, understanding there. &quot;Part of you must be overjoyed to be a nakhudha again.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story was good, and actually it was nice to read something that whilst it had heavy moments, (mild spoilers) you don't have to worry about beloved characters suddenly dying in the same way that I've had in some other books this year (cough She Who Became...). It's a great blend of history, religious elements, fantastical elements, magic, and reality. I'm looking forward to reading more in this series, and I hope we also get more time with characters like Raksh.</p>
