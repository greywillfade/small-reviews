<p>Another pretty short book, but again one that doesn't mess around when it comes to worldbuilding and characters. This is the story of a post-war (America vs California) existence where robots gain some rights, and a group of them end up running a biang biang noodle restaurant. I'd actually seen this recommended by someone on an end of year list and had added it to my backlog, but then happily got it as a Christmas present!</p>
<p>I really liked the group of characters, and whilst not a great deal happened in the story, it was all focused on exploring their pasts and relationships. The description of the post-war society and the foodie elements were also great, and all round it was like a big warm fuzzy hug. I was a bit sad there wasn't more, but all in all a very enjoyable book to end the year on.</p>
