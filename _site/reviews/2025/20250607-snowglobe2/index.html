<p>Following on from the first book, this dives straight into a light crime mystery, which initially felt a bit at odds with the rest of the tone for me. Despite the seriousness, it also isn't the main focus in itself, and most of the focus is on the twists and turns of a feud. There's similar themes to the first book, some higher levels of fantasy and quirkiness than other more gritty bits, but it's all good fun and plays out in an overall satisfying way. The character development didn't feel as strong in this one and a few people got a bit sidelined, but I did really enjoy the additional content in the world.</p>
