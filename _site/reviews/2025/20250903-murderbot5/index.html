<p>The week reading this absolutely sucked. I was ill, and we had to put our cat down. Despite/because of that I was very glad to escape into what is still an absolute gem of a book. I love everything about it, again. The length is perfect, and it packs so much into the storyline. Having read it before, certain reveals in the plot weren't new to me, but I was very pleased for more time with ART (and the bickering), 2.0, getting to know others humans, and as always all of the action. In the last run through this was a real standout amongst all the books, and the re-read is no different. Big favourite.</p>
<p>My only regret, which is absolutely not the book's fault at all, is that I read this rather than &quot;Fugitive Telemetry&quot;, which should have come chronologically before, and I'd wanted to sequence (but forgot). Note to myself for next time!</p>
