<p>This one is action action action action, and I thought it was great. I remembered more about this book than I thought I would, and interestingly certain scenes' environmental settings had wormed pictures into my brain that had persisted. This is why I don't want them all overwritten by the TV show. Also, just to flag that Rin is given a female persona in this book. Ok, maybe I'll stop going on about that soon. Maybe.</p>
<p>I remember this being a particularly strong book from the first time around, and I enjoyed the Miki storyline in particular, plus its human. (mild spoilers for non-me readers) I hadn't remembered the ending though, which actually shocked and saddened me a bit as I wasn't expecting it. I think coming off the back of the previous book and the ComfortUnit's storyline, I'd mixed up some of the positivity in my head. Anyway, strong narrative, strong characters, lots of fun.</p>
