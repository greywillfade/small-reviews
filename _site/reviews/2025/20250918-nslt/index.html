<p>I'm adding this one in way, way later than we actually played it, because every now and again we'd mop up a couple more collectibles and I finally think we're at a point where it's going to fade away in favour of other kiddy games and I should note it.</p>
<p>The kid and I actually tried the original Super Lucky's Tale (no &quot;New&quot;), which was a bit too clunky and we didn't get past about a level. If I remember correctly, it was just a bit unforgiving with lives (kids find it funny to jump off edges, but get annoyed at having to replay entire levels because of it), and some of the controls were a bit tough.</p>
<p>At some point it got replaced on GamePass and I happened across this iteration, thinking it was a sequel. I got slightly confused that it was the same but different, then realised what was going on â€“ it's an &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Super_Lucky%27s_Tale">enhanced remake</a>&quot;. And somehow, it was tweaked enough to be at just the right level to be a bit more accessible and forgiving for a 3 year old. We did a playthrough between the family, some of the kid alone, some with me or my husband doing harder bits. It had just about enough enjoyment in a retro platformer way for me to not begrudge getting involved (as opposed to some other games... looking at you, Paw Patrol), and exposed the kid to some new kind of challenges. Decent for the age range, but not standout.</p>
