<p>I feel a bit bad about this review, as the book was shared with me by a friend/ex-colleague, although he did present it with something like &quot;I'm not sure I liked this book&quot; so I guess it's also to be expected! It's also partly the reason why the book, and its semi-sequel had sat on my pile of unread books for 5 months.</p>
<p>Alien stuff happens on Earth, an eclectic mix of people are sent off after them to do... something, and obviously it all turns out badly. There are also vampires, for some reason. It felt very, very slow to me, not great storytelling, and not a lot actually happens until quite late on in the book. The 'hard science' wasn't too much of a slog, but what I did find clunky was that the book is peppered with half-explanations, some of which you come to understand, but some you don't. Yes, imagination is a thing too, but overall it felt gappy and untintentionally vague rather than deliberately encouraging reader creativity.</p>
<p>The characters were pretty much all awful, and in particular there's an assault at one point which just felt unnecessary. I get the hypothetical reasoning behind it, but much of the book was people being awful to each other (and to aliens unnecessarily) with some 'justification', and it all just left me cold. I had a few bouts of night insomnia during reading this, and never did I experience &quot;just one more chapter&quot;, more &quot;ok I can sleep now&quot;.</p>
<p>I was given another book at the same time, Echopraxia, which is a &quot;sidequel&quot; to this one. Needless to say I've ordered some other books rather than starting that one.</p>
