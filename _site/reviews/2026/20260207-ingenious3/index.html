<p>The end of the trilogy, and whilst I had high hopes it didn't quite live up to the previous one in terms of enjoyment for me. Some of that was due to the even darker turn things take – the book opens with (and has repeated references to) child sexual abuse and trafficing, and there's points in the book with references to rape, dying from cancer, and a baby gets shot up badly. It's again very dark stuff, and definitely not a series I'd recommend to anyone too young.</p>
<p>That said, the main reason I enjoyed it less was that at some point everything starts going wrong, and just stays wrong, which totally changes the flow of the plot. You end up going from rescue/escapes, to capture, to more, and it gets a bit repetitive and a bit of a slog when heavily leaning into the &quot;we're all doomed&quot; prophecy. The ending itself also felt a bit cheap and like a waste. It didn't exactly invalidate the reading experience, but I definitely feel like it could have been done in a more effective way.</p>
<p>Overall I really enjoyed the series, and I've found them to be really good reads. But definitely not one to go into without content warnings, and this certainly isn't a happy way to wrap up the trilogy!</p>
