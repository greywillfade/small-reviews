<p>It initially took me a while to get up to speed with reading this, which I eventually worked out was not having the usual page-turner, just-another-chapter aspect of not knowing what happens (as I'd already seen the TV show). However as I went on, I really enjoyed revisiting the characters and story. On finishing it I'm looking forward to working my way through the rest. And it's also worth acknowledging that it's just a bloody good read, with or without the TV show.</p>
