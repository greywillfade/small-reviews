<p>I struggled to give this one a rating. It's a very good book; it's a 4 really. On finishing it I wanted to re-read it to see what references and connections I'd missed now the web had all been laid out for me... except I didn't want to. It's probably the timing, of going into another winter in a pandemic that people have all-but given up on, but this book was just a bit <em>too</em> bleak for me right now. Yes, there are also themes of persistence and hope and community, but it won't be those images that stay with me, it'll be the thought of a euthanasia rollercoaster for kids.</p>
