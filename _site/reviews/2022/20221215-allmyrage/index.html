<p>I liked this book more and more and more as it went on. By the end, it made me cry, which not much does. This is a wonderful, touching story about the lives of 3 main characters, told through chapters from each's perspective... kind of. You see some of the plot points coming a mile off, but that doesn't take away from letting it all play out. I really enjoyed the characters, the writing, and the use of music to illustrate key moments and themes. And references to Saga and Lying Cat. A really enjoyable book.</p>
