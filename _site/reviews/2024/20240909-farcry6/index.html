<p>I'd never played a Far Cry game before, and I'm not quite sure what posessed me to pick up this one because I knew so little about it all that I had to check whether the story was a continuation of previous games (gladly it isn't). I also kept referring to it as &quot;Just Cause&quot; for ages (also games I've never really played).</p>
<p>Despite that rather rocky start, as soon as I got a crocodile as my buddy I was sold. The story in particular was actually meaningful and pretty well done, and the characters were interesting. I liked some of the little touches, like my Dani singing along to songs that come on the radio in vehicles. Speaking of vehicles though, they suck. I've possibly never seen a worse rendered horseriding animation, and I tried to avoid cars and tanks at all costs, which is a shame. The amigos though were a lot of fun.</p>
<p>I ran out of steam after finishing the main story, especially as it transpired that the insurgencies would mean that I <em>had</em> to keep clearing out bases, which really compromised fast travel. I did a couple of runs of the Special Operations, but these are clearly a lot more fun and feasible with a friend... which I do not have ðŸ¥². But all in all very enjoyable.</p>
