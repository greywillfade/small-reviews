<p>I'd read and loved the Imperial Radch series by Ann Leckie, which, when I think back to what was going on at the time, is a terrifyingly long time ago now. I remember broad strokes about those books, but I'd very much like to re-read them now after having read this one. I find Leckie's writing style very easy to read, the characters are easy to get on board with, and I really enjoyed finding out a bit more about some of the races/factions that were less well detailed in the previous books. I felt there was a bit too much heavy-handed, almost teenage angst when it came to two primary characters, and another gripe was the far-too-murderbot-esque use of a TV show as a plot device. But overall it was forgivable and this was a nice addition to the context of the universe.</p>
