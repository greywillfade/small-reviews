<p>I've read and watched enough &quot;crash land on an abandoned planet and go into an empty building&quot; sci-fi to never feel entirely at ease in a game like this, but the jump scares thankfully never came. This was a very straightforward story-based game that occasionally chucks you a light puzzle and either offers to solve it for you or tells you what to do. Its graphics and environments are actually pretty nice, and far better than the cover art implies. The choices you have to make aren't super meaningful (aside from the ending), but they do take you on slightly different paths, and definitely make you have to replay to get all of the conversations and achievements. Even as an achievement junkie it's not quite fun enough for me to want to do that, and would definitely have needed at least a fast walk option for me to seriously consider it. But I was pleasantly surprised, and it kept me occupied.</p>
