<p>I could remember the broad brush strokes of the first book, but had to read some summaries to remember most details as it'd been ages (Dec 22) when I read the first one. As before, I really liked the character and the world, and it's a story with heart. However I didn't think the story was very strong. I'm actually writing this late, in August, and I'm already struggling to remember bits. There was also some clunkiness in the writing, notably in the family reunion party. Despite that, again, I'm keen to read the end of the trilogy and will try to pick it up before too much time passes.</p>
