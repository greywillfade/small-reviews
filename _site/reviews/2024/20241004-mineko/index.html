<p>Cute, grindy, buggy. This was a cosy game that was a bit <em>too</em> cosy and slow. Particularly at the end when you're trying to finish quests and you're having to skip entire weeks to get to the night market in the hope that a certain item will be randomly generated that day, it got very tedious. Money lost all necessity quite far from the end of all quests, and in general the pacing was just very off. It was pretty and I liked the cuteness and cats, but the ending also felt a bit janky. Not something I'd rush to recommend or play again.</p>
