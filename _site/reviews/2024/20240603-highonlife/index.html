<p>I like silly shooty games. Borderlands, Psychonauts... but this isn't another. Very quickly this game established itself as just <em>too</em> far over the line of &quot;teenage boy&quot; for me. Where Borderlands has loot coming out of toilets, sure, it also has plot depth and real heart. This game had dialogue at a level of &quot;Why am I called Old Wet Grundy? Well, my name's Grundy and I like to piss myself. I'm doing it right now!&quot;. The endless stream of &quot;sex, wee wee, poo poo, hur hur&quot;, attempts at being shocking through things like joking about child murder, and then just frankly <em>very weak</em>, tedious, unskippable dialogue turned me off. But speaking of turning off, you can switch off some of the bants. And then you're just left with a lazy shooter. The lack of a map is horrible and the environments are unmemorable so locations make no sense. The level select is clunky. The inconsistent environment where you suddenly hit invisible walls. The lack of progress trackers on tedious incremental tasks. In short, don't recommend.</p>
