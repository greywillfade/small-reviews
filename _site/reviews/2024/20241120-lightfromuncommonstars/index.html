<p>Entirely unintentionally, but fittingly, I finished this book on the Transgender Day of Rememberence (this is a book which follows the journey of a trans woman, and is also written by a transgender author). The plot, whilst being deeply human and touching at its core, is also one that includes violin culture, demons, magic powers, aliens, stargates, and sentient AI, all smushed into details of day to day life, restaurants and delicious menu items in a US town. It's clearly one of those books that definitely isn't for everyone! I enjoyed it, the story was fun and engaging whilst having depth and meaning through Katrina's story, but it also wasn't perfect, and had a fair amount of clunkiness in different ways.</p>
