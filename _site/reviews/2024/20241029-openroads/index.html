<p>This isn't a <em>game</em> game, it's a semi-interactive story. There's minimal conversation choices, all of which seem pretty superficial, and you can walk around and examine objects which sometimes spark dialogue prompts. Many of them don't though. I enjoyed the story, but I didn't enjoy the slightly jarring art style where sometimes the characters are animated and sometimes they're flat. The walk speed was again waaaaay too slow, and I wished that there was more consistency in objects - picking up everything just to see if it gave me a conversation prompt was tedious. However for a very short game those were tolerable, it's a cute game, but not really my thing.</p>
