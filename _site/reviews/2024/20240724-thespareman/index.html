<p>I really enjoyed the first two Lady Astronaut series by the author, and found them very easy reading so bought this for a long transatlantic flight to the US West coast as a light read. I spent most of my time on the plane with this, and finished it off in some jetlagged moments after arriving. Like her previous books, my main criticism was the sheer cringe of the romantic writing. Sadly this is set around a couple on honeymoon, so there's a fair amount of it. That aside though, I found myself liking it more and more as I went along. Whilst it didn't connect with me in the same way as her previous books, I thought the fluffiness of the space cruise ship, the fun of the murder mystery, plus the important topic of PTSD and the main character's personal journey were all great. Not a classic, but incredibly enjoyable nonetheless.</p>
