<p>A 'work book', this tells the story of Clearview AI and facial recognition technology, and in my head is called &quot;All Your Face Are Belong To Us&quot; (but I'm <a href="https://x.com/kashhill/status/1724199871278694659">not the only one</a> â€“Â warning, Twitter link ðŸ¥´).</p>
<p>It was an interesting tale, as well as giving some great insight into the technicalities of how the field has grown up, but in a very accessible way. That said, it took me ages to finish, again suffering from non-fictionitis and not being driven to keep going. And it also felt a bit formulaic at times, often starting chapters with introducing the new main character, giving an (often negatively physically portrayed) description of them, before diving into their role.</p>
