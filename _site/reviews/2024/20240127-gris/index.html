<p>I picked this up after flicking through my play later queue one lunchtime, looking for something fairly light that I could sink 20 minutes into without getting too invested. To be honest, I chose this over other things mostly because the artwork looked nice. On starting, this is one of those games that explains <em>nothing</em>. I was wandering around, not sure what I would be encountering or what my goals were, and coming across things that I could collect without having any idea what they were. The first couple of times I found what I later grew to understand was a colletible, I actually thought I was maybe triggering save points or something. Other things I came across gave lots of satisfying &quot;ohhh&quot; moments when I realised how it all works. With other similar games that level of obscurity has sometimes been a bit much, and I've needed to look up what things were for, because it passed the point of feeling like I should have worked it out or been given some context. But Gris is paced perfectly in that regard. I was quite content to just go with it, not getting annoyed when I got locked out of areas by being thrown into cutscenes, because when everything's a mystery and you're genuinely picking a random direction to walk in to see what happens, it feels way more acceptable than in, say, my Expanse review.</p>
<p>After picking it for the artwork, the visuals of the game itself did not disappoint. It's <em>stunning</em>. It's genuinely one of the most beautiful things I've played, and there were some wonderful 'surprise and delight' moments of the design that genuinely did delight me. This is a game about grief, and it's emotionally heavy without being difficult, and that carries through into the gameplay and puzzles. In two instances I thought &quot;gah, I hate chase sequences&quot;, but you just can't die in this game and it's (mostly..) inconsequntial as to how much you engage. Gris is described as &quot;a serene and evocative experience, free of danger, frustration or death&quot; and I found that to be the case. My one, one criticism, which I considered knocking .5 marks off for, was unskippable cutscenes. They only came into play when I was redoing segments (bonus points for being able to jump to parts of levels) for achievements though, and actually it was only the pre-eel cut scene that I had to see a couple of times... and since they're lovely I actually didn't really mind.</p>
<p>Just a wonderful game, and one I'm very glad I stumbled across.</p>
