<p>I'm way behind in writing this, and can't remember exactly when I finished this, but it was around this time. This was a book lent to me by my aunt, via my mum, after they both visited Japan for the first time this year. I'm not really one for youtubers and hadn't watched any content by the author before, so went into this completely cold in terms of his personal journey. And it was ok. It obviously made me nostalgic for Japan, and there were some nice enough stories, but overall not something that I'd recommend unless you were a fan of his and wanted to hear a but more.</p>
