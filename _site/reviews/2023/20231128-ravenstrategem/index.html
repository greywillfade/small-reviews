<p>I was genuinely surprised and delighted at just how much I enjoyed this book, and how weirdly accessible it suddenly felt compared to the first. I just went back and read my thoughts on Ninefox Gambit, and considering I read it almost exactly a year ago I was amazed at how easily I fell back into the universe. Things that felt vague and not-fully-graspable before were put into context very quickly and easily in this book. Characters were easy to follow, and the story, whilst pretty predictable, played out in an enjoyable way. On finishing this I actually went back and picked up Ninefox Gambit, reading through the first chapter and flicking through some key conversations (I'd remembered some elements and totally forgotten others, like the whole part of Mikodez and Kujen initially) and it all actually made sense. I'll probably re-read it properly at some point.</p>
<p>I'm still not entirely sure what the difference is between the two books to make them feel so vastly different accessibility-wise, but again I'm clearly not alone from reading other reviews. Very much looking forward to the third now though.</p>
