<p>This was a fun (if short) little distraction with some decent puzzles, some of which felt really quite satisfying to figure out. The graphics are very clunky and budget-feeling, and that carries through into the controls at points, giving some frustration when I lost time to messing about with the interface or not being able to find where the item I was clearly searching for could be. The story was basic but with a semi-amusing and weird twist, and I enjoyed the variety between the different styles of levels. I played this on Game Pass and probably wouldn't have ever bought it otherwise, but if I could pick up the DLC for cheap in future I'd definitely enjoy playing a few more levels.</p>
