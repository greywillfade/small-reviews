<p>I read this back-to-back with the preceeding novella, and because they follow on directly I think it could have made more sense to combine them. This was again a perfectly lovely little book, with very likeable characters, and lots of warm and fuzzies. The interactions between Dex and Mosscap were very reminiscient of some of the cultural exchanges from Becky Chambers' previous books which I'd always really liked...but despite all of the positives I found myself again not <em>loving</em> this. It was fine, enjoyable, but not a must-read for me for some reason.</p>
