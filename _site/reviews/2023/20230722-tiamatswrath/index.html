<p>Oooof this book! It started slow and melancholy, but after a certain point it was all go. I can't actually say too much because there's so many spoilers, but it kicks up a gear so much with various important things happening that it kind of felt like a finale in its own right. You find out a lot, and it's nicely set up for the last act. I nearly had to put it down at one point as I was so taken aback by something, and had some genuine emotional reactions. I've become so attached to the characters now, and I'm both really looking forward to and dreading the end of the series.</p>
