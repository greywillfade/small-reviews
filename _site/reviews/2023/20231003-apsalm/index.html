<p>I was looking forward to this book, as I'd seen it's about a &quot;tea monk&quot; and a robot, and things that have tea in are great. It was a perfectly pleasant short little read, and I ordered the second because it's very easy-reading, calming, and the two characters were both cute in their own ways. But also it's mostly unremarkable, there isn't much of a plot (it's a novella though), and some promising world-building didn't really go anywhere. But I'm hoping that's what the second book is for!</p>
