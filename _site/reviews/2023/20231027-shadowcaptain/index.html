<p>I &quot;read&quot; this book as... shock horror... an audiobook. I had a long solo drive to Yorkshire and back, so decided to put this on to accompany me, and then finished it off mostly when I was ill or awake in the night the following week. I mention that because I think it impacted a bit on my enjoyment. This is a fluffy, fun read which builds on some interesting concepts in the first book, and I enjoyed getting to hear from Adrana. However particularly when it was being read to me, I found some of the more descriptive passages unnecessarily long, and certain sequences dragged. Key plot points are also pretty predictable, but no less enjoyable for it. I've ordered the last book, and keen to see how it all plays out.</p>
