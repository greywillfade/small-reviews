<p>Ooof, this was a slog. I finally finished this at 4am and it helped me get back to sleep, which pretty much summed up how I felt about the book. One of my biggest issues was the structure. The book's divided into very few sections, each of which are a particular slice of time. But apart from that it's just a wall of text, which for me made pacing feel really dreary. I never felt &quot;ooh just one more chapter&quot;, and it also didn't help pace as I could give up whenever I wanted rather than pushing through to a break. Aside from that I didn't care about any of the characters, and found them forgettable. The plot picked up as it moved forward in time, but I found myself generally disappointed in the Wallfacer reveals, and other than that it all felt like it lacked a bit of cohesion.</p>
<p>Based on this and the last book I decided I couldn't face reading the third (even though it's already in the house!), so read the wikipedia summary instead. And yep, glad I made that call. Overall this series really wasn't for me.</p>
