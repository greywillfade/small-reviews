<p>Flew through this book during a week off. Really easy reading, some interesting characters, although wasn't a fan of the really cheesy and sometimes clumsy writing about attraction and sex between the main characters. A lot of the writing on anxiety and prejudice was more deft and resonated. Definitely enough to want to find out what happens next.</p>
