<p>Another one done! This one started more slowly and I was thinking it maybe didn't quite have the same hook as the others. But no, after arriving at an abandoned mining facility (what could possibly go wrong?!) it all kicked up a gear and was flat out up to the end. The inevitable twist was pretty predictable, but maybe that's just because I've read too many pessimistic space stories and am suspicious of everything.</p>
