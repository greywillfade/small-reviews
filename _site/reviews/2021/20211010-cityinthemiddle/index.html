<p>Easy to get into, and enjoyed most of this. Felt it lost its way a bit in Argelo but figured that was part of the pacing. But then the last two chapters just lost me. A bit too weird a payoff, and an unresolved ending that felt like it just gave up. Also Sophie is a dick, and there were tons of weird relationship dynamics that just didn't feel believable or something to get behind.</p>
