                <div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Revenger by Alastair Reynolds</p><p>Finished: 31st December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>Read in a covid haze, I started out feeling like I didn't have much connection to the book and it was going to be a bit of a generic slog. However the character of Fura, along with the people around her, soon changed and became much more interesting. Some of the central concepts and mysteries, like the bones, baubles, and quoins also left enough questions for me to be keen to read more in the series. In the end I enjoyed it, it was a strong read and I was excited to see how it ended.</p>
</div><div class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Dishonored: Death of the Outsider</p><p>Finished: 29th December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:3"></div><p>The Dishonored games are a series that I've enjoyed, so I picked this up on Game Pass as something to play over the Christmas period. It's basically exactly the same, even down to reusing environments, but that doesn't detract from it still being fun to play. I enjoyed it, but it loses marks for having three achievements completely bug and refuse to pop, one of which took me ages to make sure I got it. There were also little UI fails, like the markers for the contracts being off by default, which made me completely forget about them on the first mission until I saw them pop up as fails. Little bits of frustration like that ultimately just took the shine off it.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> All my rage by Sabaa Tahir</p><p>Finished: 15th December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4.5"></div><p>I liked this book more and more and more as it went on. By the end, it made me cry, which not much does. This is a wonderful, touching story about the lives of 3 main characters, told through chapters from each's perspective... kind of. You see some of the plot points coming a mile off, but that doesn't take away from letting it all play out. I really enjoyed the characters, the writing, and the use of music to illustrate key moments and themes. And references to Saga and Lying Cat. A really enjoyable book.</p>
</div><div class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Firewatch</p><p>Finished: 13th December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:4"></div><p>I've been meaning to play this for years. I think I was initially put off by thinking it was scary (it's not) way back, but on seeing it on Game Pass I downloaded it at some point before I got distracted by Overwatch 2. I happened to see it was leaving very soon, and that was the kick I needed to crack on, so I motored through it in a few hours over the last few days. I felt like the wilderness was a bit tedious and empty and this plus some clunky movement didn't make me want to explore, which was a bit of a missed opportunity. However the story was interesting and quite touching at points, and it was compelling enough to want to finish before the deadline.</p>
