                <div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Revenger by Alastair Reynolds</p><p>Finished: 31st December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>Read in a covid haze, I started out feeling like I didn't have much connection to the book and it was going to be a bit of a generic slog. However the character of Fura, along with the people around her, soon changed and became much more interesting. Some of the central concepts and mysteries, like the bones, baubles, and quoins also left enough questions for me to be keen to read more in the series. In the end I enjoyed it, it was a strong read and I was excited to see how it ended.</p>
</div><div class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Dishonored: Death of the Outsider</p><p>Finished: 29th December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:3"></div><p>The Dishonored games are a series that I've enjoyed, so I picked this up on Game Pass as something to play over the Christmas period. It's basically exactly the same, even down to reusing environments, but that doesn't detract from it still being fun to play. I enjoyed it, but it loses marks for having three achievements completely bug and refuse to pop, one of which took me ages to make sure I got it. There were also little UI fails, like the markers for the contracts being off by default, which made me completely forget about them on the first mission until I saw them pop up as fails. Little bits of frustration like that ultimately just took the shine off it.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> All my rage by Sabaa Tahir</p><p>Finished: 15th December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4.5"></div><p>I liked this book more and more and more as it went on. By the end, it made me cry, which not much does. This is a wonderful, touching story about the lives of 3 main characters, told through chapters from each's perspective... kind of. You see some of the plot points coming a mile off, but that doesn't take away from letting it all play out. I really enjoyed the characters, the writing, and the use of music to illustrate key moments and themes. And references to Saga and Lying Cat. A really enjoyable book.</p>
</div><div class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Overwatch 2</p><p>Finished: 13th December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>I'm just adding this in for posterity because I've been playing it sporadically since it came out, although given its nature I'd never be 'finished'. It's...Overwatch. But without the fun of loot boxes, and the no-fun of buying a season pass to unlock rubbish items I don't actually like. It's still a really fun game, but there's nothing new here.</p>
</div><div class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Firewatch</p><p>Finished: 13th December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:4"></div><p>I've been meaning to play this for years. I think I was initially put off by thinking it was scary (it's not) way back, but on seeing it on Game Pass I downloaded it at some point before I got distracted by Overwatch 2. I happened to see it was leaving very soon, and that was the kick I needed to crack on, so I motored through it in a few hours over the last few days. I felt like the wilderness was a bit tedious and empty and this plus some clunky movement didn't make me want to explore, which was a bit of a missed opportunity. However the story was interesting and quite touching at points, and it was compelling enough to want to finish before the deadline.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Binti by Nnedi Okorafor</p><p>Finished: 2nd December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>An extremely short read, but one that I enjoyed. Binti was a character that I could get behind from the start, and the descriptions of prejudice and difference made me both feel for her, but also helped build the world really quickly. There were a number of new terms and fantastical concepts (a ship that was a giant space prawn!) but unlike the previous book I read, I found it easy to imagine the concepts. I only wish it was a bit longer and extensive, as it felt more like a short story than a novella but I'd definitely be keen to read more.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Ninefox Gambit (The Machineries of Empire book 1) by Yoon Ha Lee</p><p>Finished: 30th November 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3"></div><p>This book reminded me of what it feels like to try to read Japanese novels a bit too far above my level: I kind of get the gist of what's going on, but I couldn't answer questions well on details. Even after finishing this book and getting the 'explainer chapters' at the end, there are fundamental bits I simply don't understand. Apparently I'm not alone, with a ton of people on Goodreads experiencing similar. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to use my imagination, and I don't need it spelled out to me exactly what a servitor, formation instinct, or exotic weapons are exactly. But right from the start the sheer level of never explained terms made the world-building feel weak and disconnected for me. Characters with non-memorable names were thrown in and soon disappear, leading to a lot of 'am I meant to know this name?' too. Despite all that, I did like the central concept, and I'm open to reading more in the series as it sounds like they're a bit more accessible...and maybe will help me put some of the pieces together about this book!</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> The Gone-Away World by Nick Harkaway</p><p>Finished: 8th November 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:2.5"></div><p>This book has floated around my awareness for ages. I'd seen it on various lists and reviews, and knew the name when it later sat around our house as one of the books my husband bought for a holiday but never read. After all that time, I was disappointed that it was not for me. It starts by describing 'Mrs Flynn the Barman's arse' which got us off on the wrong foot, but I was prepared to put this down to the narration rather than the author. And whilst there's a lot in a similar vein, it wasn't that that did it.</p>
<p>It took me at least 200 long pages of the overall 582 to remotely get into the story (which actually ends up being reasonably interesting as a concept, if a bit chaotic and all over the place in execution). This book suffers hugely from wild ramblings, in both tangents and style of writing. On one page there's a sentence with 193 words, which sadly isn't an exception. If it was a third of the size and written differently I'd have liked it a lot more. A shame!</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin</p><p>Finished: 30th October 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4.5"></div><p>I'd seen this rated highly by others, and it didn't disappoint. I'd also seen comparisons with Ready Player One, which is nonsense, and extremely lazy. If anything it reminded me more of Halt and Catch Fire. This is a beautifully written book, which perfectly captures all kinds of very human emotions and situations. The plot itself for me felt secondary to the characters, who had wonderful depth and flaws, and who felt very real after spending more and more time reading. At one point there's a very notable event, and I found myself wanting to cheat and look ahead to see if everything turned out ok or not, because I was that invested. For others the video game heavy content will be too much, but for me it was a big draw. Loved it.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> How high we go in the dark by Sequoia Nagamatsu</p><p>Finished: 14th October 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>I struggled to give this one a rating. It's a very good book; it's a 4 really. On finishing it I wanted to re-read it to see what references and connections I'd missed now the web had all been laid out for me... except I didn't want to. It's probably the timing, of going into another winter in a pandemic that people have all-but given up on, but this book was just a bit <em>too</em> bleak for me right now. Yes, there are also themes of persistence and hope and community, but it won't be those images that stay with me, it'll be the thought of a euthanasia rollercoaster for kids.</p>
