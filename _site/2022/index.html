                <div id='Book2022-12-31' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Revenger by Alastair Reynolds</p><p>Finished: 31st December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>Read in a covid haze, I started out feeling like I didn't have much connection to the book and it was going to be a bit of a generic slog. However the character of Fura, along with the people around her, soon changed and became much more interesting. Some of the central concepts and mysteries, like the bones, baubles, and quoins also left enough questions for me to be keen to read more in the series. In the end I enjoyed it, it was a strong read and I was excited to see how it ended.</p>
</div><div id='Game2022-12-29' class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Dishonored: Death of the Outsider</p><p>Finished: 29th December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:3"></div><p>The Dishonored games are a series that I've enjoyed, so I picked this up on Game Pass as something to play over the Christmas period. It's basically exactly the same, even down to reusing environments, but that doesn't detract from it still being fun to play. I enjoyed it, but it loses marks for having three achievements completely bug and refuse to pop, one of which took me ages to make sure I got it. There were also little UI fails, like the markers for the contracts being off by default, which made me completely forget about them on the first mission until I saw them pop up as fails. Little bits of frustration like that ultimately just took the shine off it.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-12-15' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> All my rage by Sabaa Tahir</p><p>Finished: 15th December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4.5"></div><p>I liked this book more and more and more as it went on. By the end, it made me cry, which not much does. This is a wonderful, touching story about the lives of 3 main characters, told through chapters from each's perspective... kind of. You see some of the plot points coming a mile off, but that doesn't take away from letting it all play out. I really enjoyed the characters, the writing, and the use of music to illustrate key moments and themes. And references to Saga and Lying Cat. A really enjoyable book.</p>
</div><div id='Game2022-12-13' class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Overwatch 2</p><p>Finished: 13th December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>I'm just adding this in for posterity because I've been playing it sporadically since it came out, although given its nature I'd never be 'finished'. It's...Overwatch. But without the fun of loot boxes, and the no-fun of buying a season pass to unlock rubbish items I don't actually like. It's still a really fun game, but there's nothing new here.</p>
</div><div id='Game2022-12-13' class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Firewatch</p><p>Finished: 13th December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:4"></div><p>I've been meaning to play this for years. I think I was initially put off by thinking it was scary (it's not) way back, but on seeing it on Game Pass I downloaded it at some point before I got distracted by Overwatch 2. I happened to see it was leaving very soon, and that was the kick I needed to crack on, so I motored through it in a few hours over the last few days. I felt like the wilderness was a bit tedious and empty and this plus some clunky movement didn't make me want to explore, which was a bit of a missed opportunity. However the story was interesting and quite touching at points, and it was compelling enough to want to finish before the deadline.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-12-02' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Binti by Nnedi Okorafor</p><p>Finished: 2nd December 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>An extremely short read, but one that I enjoyed. Binti was a character that I could get behind from the start, and the descriptions of prejudice and difference made me both feel for her, but also helped build the world really quickly. There were a number of new terms and fantastical concepts (a ship that was a giant space prawn!) but unlike the previous book I read, I found it easy to imagine the concepts. I only wish it was a bit longer and extensive, as it felt more like a short story than a novella but I'd definitely be keen to read more.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-11-30' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Ninefox Gambit (The Machineries of Empire book 1) by Yoon Ha Lee</p><p>Finished: 30th November 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3"></div><p>This book reminded me of what it feels like to try to read Japanese novels a bit too far above my level: I kind of get the gist of what's going on, but I couldn't answer questions well on details. Even after finishing this book and getting the 'explainer chapters' at the end, there are fundamental bits I simply don't understand. Apparently I'm not alone, with a ton of people on Goodreads experiencing similar. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to use my imagination, and I don't need it spelled out to me exactly what a servitor, formation instinct, or exotic weapons are exactly. But right from the start the sheer level of never explained terms made the world-building feel weak and disconnected for me. Characters with non-memorable names were thrown in and soon disappear, leading to a lot of 'am I meant to know this name?' too. Despite all that, I did like the central concept, and I'm open to reading more in the series as it sounds like they're a bit more accessible...and maybe will help me put some of the pieces together about this book!</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-11-08' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> The Gone-Away World by Nick Harkaway</p><p>Finished: 8th November 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:2.5"></div><p>This book has floated around my awareness for ages. I'd seen it on various lists and reviews, and knew the name when it later sat around our house as one of the books my husband bought for a holiday but never read. After all that time, I was disappointed that it was not for me. It starts by describing 'Mrs Flynn the Barman's arse' which got us off on the wrong foot, but I was prepared to put this down to the narration rather than the author. And whilst there's a lot in a similar vein, it wasn't that that did it.</p>
<p>It took me at least 200 long pages of the overall 582 to remotely get into the story (which actually ends up being reasonably interesting as a concept, if a bit chaotic and all over the place in execution). This book suffers hugely from wild ramblings, in both tangents and style of writing. On one page there's a sentence with 193 words, which sadly isn't an exception. If it was a third of the size and written differently I'd have liked it a lot more. A shame!</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-10-30' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin</p><p>Finished: 30th October 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4.5"></div><p>I'd seen this rated highly by others, and it didn't disappoint. I'd also seen comparisons with Ready Player One, which is nonsense, and extremely lazy. If anything it reminded me more of Halt and Catch Fire. This is a beautifully written book, which perfectly captures all kinds of very human emotions and situations. The plot itself for me felt secondary to the characters, who had wonderful depth and flaws, and who felt very real after spending more and more time reading. At one point there's a very notable event, and I found myself wanting to cheat and look ahead to see if everything turned out ok or not, because I was that invested. For others the video game heavy content will be too much, but for me it was a big draw. Loved it.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-10-14' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> How high we go in the dark by Sequoia Nagamatsu</p><p>Finished: 14th October 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>I struggled to give this one a rating. It's a very good book; it's a 4 really. On finishing it I wanted to re-read it to see what references and connections I'd missed now the web had all been laid out for me... except I didn't want to. It's probably the timing, of going into another winter in a pandemic that people have all-but given up on, but this book was just a bit <em>too</em> bleak for me right now. Yes, there are also themes of persistence and hope and community, but it won't be those images that stay with me, it'll be the thought of a euthanasia rollercoaster for kids.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-10-09' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> The best, most awful job by Katherine May</p><p>Finished: 9th October 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4"></div><p>I was given this by a very kind friend on returning home from hospital with my kid. And to be honest, since then I've been a bit scared to start it. When I looked at the title, the 'most awful' part always jumped out, and I was afraid that it'd affirm fears and limitations and upset. But it was in fact quite the opposite. In this collection of essays around motherhood (in all kinds of forms) I unexpectedly found so much resonated, but it was instead reaffirming and gave voice to many things I'd experienced and felt but maybe hadn't had the words for. I wanted to underline things to come back to, but there'd have been so much. It's a book that I'd give someone else, in the hope that they too may take so much from it.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-10-06' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir</p><p>Finished: 6th October 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>Yay, something I enjoyed! I haven't read The Martian in years, but the main character reads (from memory) as very similar. It was a nice easy read with lots of science thought gone into it, which juuust about falls on the side of helpful explanations rather than coming off as just very know it all. I was also actually really enjoying how little of the Everything Constantly Goes Wrong In Space trope it was using... until the book hits a patch of Lots Goes Wrong. Oh well. I enjoyed finding out more through the flashbacks, and generally found it an interesting idea.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-09-30' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> The Living Sea of Waking Dreams by Richard Flanagan</p><p>Finished: 30th September 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:1.5"></div><p>I was lent this by someone who didn't enjoy it, and I took that as a bit of a challenge, thinking it'd suit my tastes better. However this was really not for me either. I didn't get this book at all, which makes me feel like I'm missing something and am stupid, but I found this disjointed, without substance, repetitive, and just bloody confusing. Even after finishing I have absolutely no idea what was going on with the disappearing, which felt utterly out of place in the story about the mother's decline. I read this over a day and a half, during times where I was settling the baby's milk. That's a fast read for me, and it was partly so because I skimmed over so much of the repetitive incoherent babbling sections, and overly elaborate but tedious descriptions. An easily forgettable book.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-08-15' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Jack Four by Neal Asher</p><p>Finished: 15th August 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3"></div><p>This was another Christmas present. It's a standalone book from a universe I haven't read anything else from, but that side was ok apart from the glossary at the start making it feel more daunting than it actually was. I was going to give it 3.5 as the plot was fun and engaging enough, but as I got through the last couple of chapters I decided to downgrade it. For me, there was just too much unnecessary nastiness (mostly gore, but about 4 different explosive shitting scenes), even for an action book. I also wasn't a fan of the entirely unneeded and lazily thrown in rape scene at the start to show a character is A Bad Dude. Plus The Big Reveal at the end was incredibly obvious from much earlier on. And don't get me started on the cliched sex scene. Looking on Goodreads just now the reviews are a series of gushing men, and that's how this book feels ‚Äì a blokey bloke's read.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-08-01' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Cribsheet by Emily Oster</p><p>Finished: 1st August 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>This was a recommendation, and whilst it was interesting enough it took me ages to get through because I'm just not much of a factual book reader. It contains some content that I found very useful, and which also helped me form up and rationalise some of my thinking and decision making, so in that sense it's been good. But I'll be glad to get back to fiction again!</p>
</div><div id='Game2022-05-27' class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Tiny Tina&#39;s Wonderlands</p><p>Finished: 27th May 2022</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:4"></div><p>Silly fun in the vein of the previous games which I got a looooot of play time out of trying to clear up all the collectibles. I enjoyed the magic and way that skills were specced (e.g. dual classes), however found this ultimately missed the emotional pull of the main game characters and story as it was all throwaway make believe.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-04-30' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> The Galaxy, and the Ground Within by Becky Chambers</p><p>Finished: 30th April 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4"></div><p>Having read all of the previous Wayfarers series I'd been waiting a while for this one to come out in paperback, and it didn't disappoint. Very little happens; it's basically a book detailing conversations between the characters. However I've thoroughly enjoyed the detail of the world building in this series, particularly around the cultural aspects of different species, and this book gives lots of that. It was also nice to get to know Pei a bit better after her previous appearances.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-04-14' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Klara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro</p><p>Finished: 14th April 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>A nice little read that I chipped away at, usually across short stints in early mornings. I found the slightly mysterious and mostly left to your imagination world-building an interesting setting for the story, and enjoyed both Klara's narration/perspective and the other characters she interacts with.</p>
</div><div id='Game2022-03-29' class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Guardians of the Galaxy</p><p>Finished: 27th May 2022</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>Engaging plot, and I enjoyed the character development and team building. Combat was fun enough but often too chaotic to be properly tactical with getting individuals to lock on to specific targets, and some mechanics were pretty confusing even after finishing. I still have a load of combat-related achievements locked and can't work out whether it's because they're bugged or if I just don't know how to trigger the thing it wants ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Anything to do with flying the ship was horrible.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-03-26' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Leviathan Wakes (The Expanse book 1) by James S. A. Corey</p><p>Finished: 26th March 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4"></div><p>It initially took me a while to get up to speed with reading this, which I eventually worked out was not having the usual page-turner, just-another-chapter aspect of not knowing what happens (as I'd already seen the TV show). However as I went on, I really enjoyed revisiting the characters and story. On finishing it I'm looking forward to working my way through the rest. And it's also worth acknowledging that it's just a bloody good read, with or without the TV show.</p>
</div><div id='Game2022-03-01' class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Ori and the Will of the Wisps</p><p>Finished: 1st March 2022</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>More of the same of the first game. Enjoyed the puzzles and orb hunting, didn't enjoy the frustrating chase sequences with lack of checkpoints, especially with reduced mobility in my hands at the moment! Visually very pretty.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-02-12' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> The Storyteller by Dave Grohl</p><p>Finished: 12th February 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4"></div><p>Another Christmas present. I don't normally buy too many biographies, but obviously this is Dave! I really enjoyed the writing style, and the way that different stories were woven together. I also learnt some things that I didn't know about before. A really enjoyable, easy read.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-02-01' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> The Book of Tokyo: A City in Short Fiction by Various</p><p>Finished: 1st February 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:2.5"></div><p>A Christmas present, this collection of short stories varied in how much I enjoyed them, but I didn't absolutely love any. Given the framing I was hoping there'd be more writing about the city itself, but it was actually pretty limited. Jumps from monster story, to semi-explicit sex fantasies, to family dynamics. Lots of it felt obviously translated, and actually left me wishing it had included the Japanese too, so I could read the originals.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-01-11' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Fugitive Telemetry (Murderbot diaries 6) by Martha Wells</p><p>Finished: 11th January 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4"></div><p>Finished my Murderbot binge, and I am bereft :(. This one jumps back before Network Effect rather than carrying on, and is basically a detective story with robots. Not quite as great as some of what came before, but still incredibly enjoyable.</p>
</div><div id='Book2022-01-03' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Network Effect (Murderbot diaries 5) by Martha Wells</p><p>Finished: 3rd January 2022</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:5"></div><p>Ahhh so good! This is a longer read than all of the others, and I'm pleased as I loved it all. The pacing is absolutely bang on, I loved the evolving interactions between SecUnit and the ship, but also the introduction of storytelling from different, er, perspectives (no spoilers) brought an interesting but cohesive different dynamic to the story itself. Action, intrigue, amusing parts, humanity, was nothing I didn't like.</p>
</div><div id='Game2022-01-03' class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> The Artful Escape</p><p>Finished: 3rd January 2022</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:3"></div><p>Very gentle time-passer where you mostly walk right and play guitar as you go, interspersed by some pattern matching mini games, some dialogue, and a chance to create a wonderfully flamboyant outfit and back-story. Cute little story, known voice actors, but most notable for the absolutely stunning visuals that evolve as you play music.</p>
