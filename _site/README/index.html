<p>A tiny project for me to keep track of things I've had thoughts about after finishing them</p>
<p>This was originally a little React site for playing around with, but I then ported it to Eleventy in July 2023.
Here's some info on how to run it: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/</p>
<p>Use --serve to start up a hot-reloading local web server.</p>
<p><code>npx @11ty/eleventy --serve</code></p>
