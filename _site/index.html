It'd been on my play later list for a while, so I thought I'd give it a go in the last few days it was available. It's a kind of puzzler-not-quite-platformer with some collectable story memories that I didn't bother getting all of. I finished the main bit of the game, but even though I had a bit of time it wasn't worth mopping up the achievements or the collectables purely because it was so much of a slog to get round.</p>
<p>It's a bit of a clunky game in more ways than one. Maybe it's meant to be jarring, but the visual style and fart jokes seemed very at odds with the setup of &quot;you've just been in a car accident&quot;. The lack of a map to help you remember how to get back to somewhere you needed to take something, even though there was a non-functional map on the loading screen between areas, felt like a gap. But maybe intentional. Some of the inconsistencies in being able to pick up some of one thing but not others... the puzzle mechanics requiring you to walk a lot but it being infuriatingly slow... combat being included but feeling clunky... getting all the way through the level to pick up a collectable only to have to tediously backtrack to other levels because the exit (prev boss fight) is inaccessible... again maybe all intentional? There were some ok puzzles once the complexity ramped up a bit, outside of the mechanic problems it wasn't <em>bad</em>, and given it was short I was happy to continue on and finish it. But all in all not very strong.</p>
</div><div id='Book2025-01-05' class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Unconquerable Sun by Kate Elliott</p><p>Finished: 5th Jan 2025</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4"></div><p>This book contains a <em>lot</em> of world building. It starts with some maps, which were actually helpful as a visual aid later on, but it immediately chucks you into a world of extensive back story, different planets, races, and characters, along with some quite formal and fancy pants words being thrown around the courts that made it a little bit hard to connect with. In hindsight it made me think of the Ninefox Gambit series, which I ended up loving, and to this book's credit it became a lot more understandable a lot faster. I've just finished the book, and will be starting the second one immediately, partly because I really enjoyed it all, but also partly because I'm scared of leaving it too long between reads as I know I'll start forgetting who people are or the detail of what's gone on again.</p>
<p>In short, this centres around Princess Sun and her Companions, who are wrapped up in some political shenanigans with the different core Houses, as well as bigger picture complications between different races/factions in the wider planetary systems. Everyone seems to have complex parent issues, there's a load of spying and assassination attempts, and lots of action. Good fun, good action, lots to like.</p>
</div><div id='Game2025-01-04' class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</p><p>Finished: 4th January 2025</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>Coming off the back of Dragon Age ‚Äì a game where the polish really impressed me ‚Äì some clunkiness in this one made the experience a bit less than I'd hoped. The story was pretty good and I enjoyed it, as well as watching the extended cutscenes to move between the various settings. However some of the gameplay got tedious, particularly my hours lost to the terrible maps and trying to work out just how to get back to several bits in underground systems that you can't do in the same way as you first came in, or can't remember very well.</p>
<p>The lack of polish and contrasts I mention was in little things, like the way that potentially interesting dialogue got cut off abruptly rather than dealt with elegantly and resuming in a nice way in DA. Dialogue, that in some cases then continued to trigger annoyingly repeatedly and inelegantly even when I wasn't near the item of discussion (I was underground at that point). My husband was impressed by the animation, and whilst it was pretty good generally, I wasn't impressed by the faces... again there was a fair bit of clunkiness there. I'm mentioning these things because for such a cinematic game, they broke me out a bit.</p>
<p>I did like the range of the puzzles, from the bastard final &quot;secret ending&quot; one, through to the cogwheels, the spinny disk ones, and all the other more general ones. On the whole they weren't taxing, and could maybe have been a bit more complex and less on rails in some cases, but they were a nice extra dimension.</p>
<p>My final and most personal issue is about the absolutely stressful giant REDACTED sequences in the third main game area. Nononono thank you!</p>
