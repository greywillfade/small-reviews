                <div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> The Three-body Problem by Liu Cixin</p><p>Finished: 14th July 2023</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>Another book my husband never finished and I eventually nicked. He'd bought three in the series and there was enough in this to move on to them at some point, but it wasn't a classic for me. It felt a bit clunky to read at points, in the way that translated things often do, but I appreciated the translator's postscript saying that 'the reader sees a glimpse of another culture's pattern of thinking, hears an echo of another language's rhythms and cadences, and feels a tremor of another people's gestures and movements'. The strange in-game scenes reminded me of something else but I can't remember what, and I enjoyed flicking between that and the real world with everything explained by the end, but I did find some of the science a bit hard to wrap my tired brain around at points. Still, some interesting concepts and I'll read on.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Sea of tranquility by Emily St. John Mandel</p><p>Finished: 14th May 2023</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>I liked this more as it went on and all the strands came together, and it was a decent time travel read that wrapped up all the mysteries nicely... but overall something still left me a little bit cold. I think it may have been that I just didn't care about the characters very much. I actually felt a bit like Gaspery at the point where he still felt able to be detached about knowing how and when the people would die. They never really properly came alive for me. However I also definitely find pandemic-related content a bit less fun to read nowadays, and I think this probably suffered a bit in the same way as how I felt about 'How high we go in the dark' in terms of the setting.</p>
</div><div class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Hi-fi Rush</p><p>Finished: 13th July 2023</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>Another game that's finished-but-not-finished as there's a zillion achievements and I may mop some more up, but my enthusiasm is waning a bit now as there's just too many to get through. This was a fun little game which was very up my street in terms of puns, silly references, and 4th wall breaking. I laughed when Left Shark made an appearance, but it was even better to get to add that as my costume. Gameplay and story-wise it was very enjoyable if a bit repetitive, and the main things that let it down for me were mostly technical niggles: not having a way to calibrate the audio, the music being really monotonous and samey at times, wishing I could replay just individual fights rather than 1h+ entire levels, achievements not stacking, general collectables being locked behind some bloody hard SPECTRA doors, and needing at least 5 full play throughs just to be able to get everything is silly. But it's a silly game, and I forgive it purely on the basis of the 'kenkyuu very much' pun in the Japanese audio.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Persepolis Rising (The Expanse book 7) by James S. A. Corey</p><p>Finished: 25th June 2023</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4"></div><p>This was the first book where I didn't know what was going to happen, and it was somewhat strange and exciting because of it. The time leap threw me off ‚Äì everyone's suddenly got older and I felt a bit of a sense of disconnection, but I guess that's what all the novellas are for (I haven't read any yet as I don't really like e/audiobooks). Despite that, this was a meaty story with lots going on on different fronts, and it feels like it put a lot of time into setting up the last couple of books. It's definitely left everything on a bit of a cliffhanger. Lots of action, lots of political wranglings and lessons, and lots of &quot;oh just one more chapter then&quot;s.</p>
</div><div class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p><p>Finished: 10th June 2023</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:4.5"></div><p>I haven't been able to <em>finish</em> finish this as I'm a victim of the bounty hunting never triggering properly, and am eagerly awaiting Patch 6 so I can clean that and the last two achievements up. But I loved this. I was recently asked why I only gave the previous game 3 stars, which made me look back. And they've basically fixed all of the things that annoyed me before. Ok, so the first time I had to fly a birdthing I found it incredibly unintuitive, some of the platforming was still janky, but there was so much to love that I could put that aside this time. The big, open worlds were a joy. The huge amount of collectables were right up my street, coupled with being marked on the map to mop up at just the right pacing. The map is actually useful! There is fast travel! Riding things! The story was great, and I actually spoiled it for myself because I now really like Merrin and I was getting worried she may not be ok. Some of the force tears were wickedly hard, but I managed them with some persistence. Really great game, can't wait for more.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Redshirts by John Scalzi</p><p>Finished: 11th May 2023</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>This was a holiday read, and was perfect fluff for that kind of situation. It's lighthearted and silly, and leaves you with good feels on various fronts. However it didn't feel massively memorable or like I'll look back on it as a highlight, but that's ok because it completely served its purpose!</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Babylon&#39;s Ashes (The Expanse book 6) by James S. A. Corey</p><p>Finished: 25th April 2023</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>I think I'm getting a bit Expansed out now. I still enjoyed this one, but felt like I was running out of steam a bit. The sheer range of characters who took point on chapters made this almost feel like a collection of short stories, as some of them were real nobodies who never got another chance to narrate, just popping up in other characters' goes. That said, I did actually enjoy that we got to see a bit from the Free Navy on Medina's perspective of how it all went down. Seeing Filip develop was also interesting to read, and I enjoyed how him and Marco read slightly differently to the other characters.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Nemesis Games (The Expanse book 5) by James S. A. Corey</p><p>Finished: 28th March 2023</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4"></div><p>After the previous one, I flicked through this before I started and was excited to see all the chapters were from the perspective of the core group... hooray! It delivered too, I actually felt like this was probably more effective than the TV show in describing how everyone split up and went on their own journeys. Naomi's journey in particular was really great to revisit in written form.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Cibola Burn (The Expanse book 4) by James S. A. Corey</p><p>Finished: 5th March 2023</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>This one was definitely a bit more of a slog. It continued to have fewer of the core team narrating chapters, the on-planet bits really dragged, and for large chunks of the book both Elvi and Basia were pretty annoying. However, I did enjoy both Basia and Havelock being a continuation of previous appearances, unlike in the TV show. Still very enjoyable, but I'm hoping for a bit more excitement and a bit less moping and mud in the next book.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Abaddon&#39;s Gate (The Expanse book 3) by James S. A. Corey</p><p>Finished: 16th February 2023</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4"></div><p>Ok so I'm fully invested now, and just continuing the binge. This one I felt like I enjoyed slightly less, but the thought of giving it anything less than a 4 felt daft, so 4 it is. I think it was because so much of this one focuses on non-core characters, although Melba/Clarissa was my favourite. On finishing I went and read all the TV summaries to compare, and a <em>lot</em> differs in this, especially with the weird smushing of Pa/Ashford/Drummer/Sam/Bull. Lots of action, lots of pace, and heading straight into book 4 to keep it up.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> Caliban&#39;s War (The Expanse book 2) by James S. A. Corey</p><p>Finished: 9th February 2023</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:4"></div><p>Unlike book 1, I just kept wanting to read this and frequently found myself slipping into the next chapter despite meaning to stop. Which I guess was kind of like the TV show when it reached this point. My memory is a bit hazy, but there are definitely some divergences from the adaptation in here, which did keep it more fresh for my brain than book 1. But also, the writing and characters are just so rich, and I loved spending more time with them. Avasarala and Bobbie were my faves in this book (obviously), but I'm also enjoying reclaiming being able to like Alex. Just great writing, and I couldn't resist ordering book 3 to jump into next.</p>
</div><div class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Townscaper</p><p>Finished: 30th January 2023</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:3.5"></div><p>This had been in my backlog for ages, and I finally downloaded it when looking for something throwaway that I could pick up and put down quickly whilst the baby napped. This was perfect, it was very cute and surprisingly fun. You're chucked straight in, no guide to the controls, and no explanation. Initially I found some frustration with things like not realising the grid wasn't straight... but soon that changed into &quot;oh cool, it did <em>that</em>!&quot;. What you build, and how that relates to the structures and grid around it means you get little delighters, like buildings changing into a lighthouse, or washing being hung out between two towers. I loved that birds settled on my wooden struts and roof of another large building. I played longer than I expected, and really enjoyed the gentle exploration it encouraged.</p>
</div><div class="card card--book"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Open book">üìñ</span> To Sleep in a Sea of Stars by Christopher Paolini</p><p>Finished: 28th January 2023</p><div class="stars stars--book" style="--rating:3"></div><p>On starting this (unexpectedly thick!) book, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to stomach it for so many pages. The early pages are sickly sweet cheese, focusing on two characters who &quot;babe&quot; each other and generally seemed extremely annoying. Thankfully (mild spoiler) one gets killed off shortly after (hooray!), and the clumsy writing only reared its head a couple more times (the description of period pains was classic). It felt like a bit of a slog to get through, as whilst there's several acts and stuff happens, none of it felt super captivating to me. The story is interesting enough though, and it's very well thought out in terms of all of the hard details, for me it just could have done with being a bit more punchy and a bit less clumsy when it comes to a man writing about a woman.</p>
</div><div class="card card--game"><p class="card-title"><span role="img" aria-label="Game controller">üéÆ</span> Deathloop</p><p>Finished: 16th January 2023</p><div class="stars stars--game" style="--rating:4.5"></div><p>I thought this was a bloody great game. It was tons of fun. The sense of play and exploration it gave me when the world opened up properly and I could start to experiment with cause and effect was brilliant, and I'm still enjoying mopping up the last few bits I'd missed. The story was fun, the combat was fun, the powers were fun. I found it hard without being annoying, although at one point (ClassPass/Juliana issues) I was sorely tempted to up my number of Reprises but thankfully couldn't figure out why it was locked so didn't (I later realised it unlocks in between levels...). Now the game's over I feel horrendously overpowered, and I've been enjoying trying to get missing achievements in ways which make me use non-standard loadouts and play styles to get them done. More than once I fell asleep at night thinking about how to run part of a level, and I think this game will be genuinely memorable for me.</p>
